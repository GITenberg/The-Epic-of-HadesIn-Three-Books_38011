<h1>THE EPIC OF HADES.</h1>

<p class="v2 i0">In February, when the dawn was slow,<br />
And winds lay still, I gazed upon the fields<br />
Which stretched before me, lifeless, and the stream<br />
Which laboured in the distance to the sea,<br />
Sullen and cold. No force of fancy took<br />
My thought to bloomy June, when all the land<br />
Lay deep in crested grass, and through the dew<br />
The landrail brushed, and the lush banks were set<br />
With strawberries, and the hot noise of bees<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span><br />
Lulled the bright flowers. Rather I seemed to move<br />
Thro' that weird land, Hellenic fancy feigned,<br />
Beyond the fabled river and the bark<br />
Of Charon; and forthwith on every side<br />
Rose the thin throng of ghosts.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">First thro' the gloom<br />
Of a dark grove I strayed&mdash;a sluggish wood,<br />
Where scarce the faint fires of the setting stars,<br />
Or some cold gleam of half-discovered dawn,<br />
Might pierce the darkling pines. A twilight drear<br />
Brooded o'er all the depths, and filled the dank<br />
And sunken hollows of the rocks with shapes<br />
Of terror,&mdash;beckoning hands and noiseless feet<br />
Flitting from shade to shade, wide eyes that stared<br />
With horror, and dumb mouths which seemed to cry,<br />
Yet cried not. An ineffable despair<br />
Hung over them and that dark world and took<br />
The gazer captive, and a mingled pang<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span><br />
Of grief and anger, grown to fierce revolt<br />
And hatred of the Invisible Force which holds<br />
The issue of our lives and binds us fast<br />
Within the net of Fate; as the fisher takes<br />
The little quivering sea-things from the sea<br />
And flings them gasping on the beach to die<br />
Then spreads his net for more. And then again<br />
I knew myself and those, creatures who lie<br />
Safe in the strong grasp of Unchanging Law,<br />
Encompassed round by hands unseen, and chains<br />
Which do support the feeble life that else<br />
Were spent on barren space; and thus I came<br />
To look with less of horror, more of thought,<br />
And bore to see the sight of pain that yet<br />
Should grow to healing, when the concrete stain<br />
Of life and act were purged, and the cleansed soul,<br />
Renewed by the slow wear and waste of time,<br />
Soared after æons of days.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i27">They seemed alone,<br />
Those prisoners, thro' all time. Each soul shut fast<br />
In its own jail of woe, apart, alone,<br />
For evermore alone; no thought of kin,<br />
Or kindly human glance, or fellowship<br />
Of suffering or of sin, made light the load<br />
Of solitary pain. Ay, though they walked<br />
Together, or were prisoned in one cell<br />
With the partners of their wrong, or with strange souls<br />
Which the same Furies tore, they knew them not,<br />
But suffered still alone; as in that shape<br />
Of hell fools build on earth, where hopeless sin<br />
Rots slow in solitude, nor sees the face<br />
Of men, nor hears the sound of speech, nor feels<br />
The touch of human hand, but broods a ghost,<br />
Hating the bare blank cell&mdash;the other self,<br />
Which brought it thither&mdash;hating man and God,<br />
And all that is or has been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i27">A great fear<br />
And pity froze my blood, who seemed to see<br />
A half-remembered form.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">An Eastern King<br />
It was who lay in pain. He wore a crown<br />
Upon his aching brow, and his white robe<br />
Was jewelled with fair gems of price, the signs<br />
Of pomp and honour and all luxury,<br />
Which might prevent desire. But as I looked<br />
There came a hunger in the gloating eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span><br />
A quenchless thirst upon the parching lips,<br />
And such unsatisfied strainings in the hands<br />
Stretched idly forth on what I could not see,<br />
Some fatal food of fancy; that I knew<br />
The undying worm of sense, which frets and gnaws<br />
The unsatisfied stained soul.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Seeing me, he said:<br />
"What? And art thou too damned as I? Dost know<br />
This thirst as I, and see as I the cool<br />
Lymph drawn from thee and mock thy lips; and parch<br />
For ever in continual thirst; and mark<br />
The fair fruit offered to thy hunger fade<br />
Before thy longing eyes? I thought there was<br />
No other as I thro' all the weary lengths<br />
Of Time the gods have made, who pined so long<br />
And found fruition mock him.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">Long ago,<br />
When I was young on earth, 'twas a sweet pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span><br />
To ride all day in the long chase, and feel<br />
Toil and the summer fire my blood and parch<br />
My lips, while in my father's halls I knew<br />
The cool bath waited, with its marble floor;<br />
And juices from the ripe fruits pressed, and chilled<br />
With snows from far-off peaks; and troops of slaves;<br />
And music and the dance; and fair young forms.<br />
And dalliance, and every joy of sense,<br />
That haunts the dreams of youth, which strength and ease<br />
Corrupt, and vacant hours. Ay, it was sweet<br />
For a while to plunge in these, as fair boys plunge<br />
Naked in summer streams, all veil of shame<br />
Laid by, only the young dear body bathed<br />
And sunk in its delight, while the firm earth,<br />
The soft green pastures gay with innocent flowers,<br />
Or sober harvest fields, show like a dream;<br />
And nought is left, but the young life which floats<br />
Upon the depths of death, to sink, maybe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span><br />
And drown in pleasure, or rise at length grown wise<br />
And gain the abandoned shore.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Ah, but at last<br />
The swift desire waxed stronger and more strong,<br />
And feeding on itself, grows tyrannous;<br />
And the parched soul no longer finds delight<br />
In the cool stream of old; nay, this itself,<br />
Smitten by the fire of sense as by a flame,<br />
Holds not its coolness more; and fevered limbs,<br />
Seeking the fresh tides of their youth, may find<br />
No more refreshment, but a cauldron fired<br />
With the fires of nether hell; and a black rage<br />
Usurps the soul, and drives it on to slake<br />
Its thirst with crime and blood.</p>

<p class="v0 i33">Longing Desire!<br />
Unsatisfied, sick, impotent Desire!<br />
Oh, I have known it ages long. I knew<br />
Its pain on earth ere yet my life had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span><br />
To its full stature, thro' the weary years<br />
Of manhood, nay, in age itself; I knew<br />
The quenchless weary thirst, unsatisfied<br />
By all the charms of sense, by wealth and power<br />
And homage; always craving, never quenched&mdash;<br />
The undying curse of the soul! The ministers<br />
And agents of my will drave far and wide<br />
Through all the land for me, seeking to find<br />
Fresh pleasures for me, who had spent my sum<br />
Of pleasure, and had power, not even in thought,<br />
Nor faculty to enjoy. They tore apart<br />
The sacred claustral doors of home for me,<br />
Defiled the inviolate hearth for me, laid waste<br />
The flower of humble lives, in hope to heal<br />
The sickly fancies of the king, till rose<br />
A cry of pain from all the land; and I<br />
Grew happier for it, since I held the power<br />
To quench desire in blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i27">But even thus<br />
The old pain faded not, but swift again<br />
Revived; and thro' the sensual dull lengths<br />
Of my seraglios I stalked, and marked<br />
The glitter of the gems, the precious webs<br />
Plundered from every clime by cruel wars<br />
That strewed the sands with corpses; lovely eyes<br />
That looked no look of love, and fired no more<br />
Thoughts of the flesh; rich meats, and fruits, and wines<br />
Grown flat and savourless; and loathed them all,<br />
And only cared for power; content to shed<br />
Rivers of innocent blood, if only thus<br />
I might appease my thirst. Until I grew<br />
A monster gloating over blood and pain.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah, weary, weary days, when every sense<br />
Was satisfied, and nothing left to slake<br />
The parched unhappy soul, except to watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><br />
The writhing limbs and mark the slow blood drip,<br />
Drop after drop, as the life ebbed with it;<br />
In a new thrill of lust, till blood itself<br />
Palled on me, and I knew the fiend I was,<br />
Yet cared not&mdash;I who was, brief years ago,<br />
Only a careless boy lapt round with ease,<br />
Stretched by the soft and stealing tide of sense<br />
Which now grew red; nor ever dreamed at all<br />
What Furies lurked beneath it, but had shrunk<br />
In indolent horror from the sight of tears<br />
And misery, and felt my inmost soul<br />
Sicken with the thought of blood. There comes a time<br />
When the insatiate brute within the man,<br />
Weary with wallowing in the mire, leaps forth<br />
Devouring, and the cloven satyr-hoof<br />
Grows to the rending claw, and the lewd leer<br />
To the horrible fanged snarl, and the soul sinks<br />
And leaves the man a devil, all his sin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span><br />
Grown savourless, and yet he longs to sin<br />
And longs in vain for ever.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">Yet, methinks,<br />
It was not for the gods to leave me thus.<br />
I stinted not their worship, building shrines<br />
To all of them; the Goddess of Love I served<br />
With hecatombs, letting the fragrant fumes<br />
Of incense and the costly steam ascend<br />
From victims year by year; nay, my own son<br />
Pelops, my best beloved, I gave to them<br />
Offering, as he must offer who would gain<br />
The great gods' grace, my dearest.</p>

<p class="v0 i35">I had gained<br />
Through long and weary orgies that strange sense<br />
Of nothingness and wasted days which blights<br />
The exhausted life, bearing upon its front<br />
Counterfeit knowledge, when the bitter ash<br />
Of Evil, which the sick soul loathes, appears<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span><br />
Like the pure fruit of Wisdom. I had grown<br />
As wizards seem, who mingle sensual rites<br />
And forms impure with murderous spells and dark<br />
Enchantments; till the simple people held<br />
My very weakness wisdom, and believed<br />
That in my blood-stained palace-halls, withdrawn,<br />
I kept the inner mysteries of Zeus<br />
And knew the secret of all Being; who was<br />
A sick and impotent wretch, so sick, so tired,<br />
That even bloodshed palled.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">For my stained soul,<br />
Knowing its sin, hastened to purge itself<br />
With every rite and charm which the dark lore<br />
Of priestcraft offered to it. Spells obscene,<br />
The blood of innocent babes, sorceries foul<br />
Muttered at midnight&mdash;these could occupy<br />
My weary days; till all my people shrank<br />
To see me, and the mother clasped her child<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span><br />
Who heard the monster pass.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">They would not hear.<br />
They listened not&mdash;the cold ungrateful gods&mdash;<br />
For all my supplications; nay, the more<br />
I sought them were they hidden.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">At the last<br />
A dark voice whispered nightly: 'Thou, poor wretch,<br />
That art so sick and impotent, thyself<br />
The source of all thy misery, the great gods<br />
Ask a more precious gift and excellent<br />
Than alien victims which thou prizest not<br />
And givest without a pang. But shouldst thou take<br />
Thy costliest and fairest offering,<br />
'Twere otherwise. The life which thou hast given<br />
Thou mayst recall. Go, offer at the shrine<br />
Thy best belovèd Pelops, and appease<br />
Zeus and the averted gods, and know again<br />
The youth and joy of yore.'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i28">Night after night,<br />
While all the halls were still, and the cold stars<br />
Were fading into dawn, I lay awake<br />
Distraught with warring thoughts, my throbbing brain<br />
Filled with that dreadful voice. I had not shrunk<br />
From blood, but this, the strong son of my youth&mdash;<br />
How should I dare this thing? And all day long<br />
I would steal from sight of him and men, and fight<br />
Against the dreadful thought, until the voice<br />
Seared all my burning brain, and clamoured, 'Kill!<br />
Zeus bids thee, and be happy.' Then I rose<br />
At midnight, when the halls were still, and raised<br />
The arras, and stole soft to where my son<br />
Lay sleeping. For one moment on his face<br />
And stalwart limbs I gazed, and marked the rise<br />
And fall of his young breast, and the soft plume<br />
Which drooped upon his brow, and felt a thrill<br />
Of yearning; but the cold voice urging me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><br />
Burned me like fire. Three times I gazed and turned<br />
Irresolute, till last it thundered at me,<br />
'Strike, fool! thou art in hell; strike, fool! and lose<br />
The burden of thy chains.' Then with slow step<br />
I crept as creeps the tiger on the deer,<br />
Raised high my arm, shut close my eyes, and plunged<br />
My dagger in his heart.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">And then, with a flash,<br />
The veil fell downward from my life and left<br />
Myself to me&mdash;the daily sum of sense&mdash;<br />
The long continual trouble of desire&mdash;<br />
The stain of blood blotting the stain of lust&mdash;<br />
The weary foulness of my days, which wrecked<br />
My heart and brain, and left me at the last<br />
A madman and accursèd; and I knew,<br />
Far higher than the sensual slope which held<br />
The gods whom erst I worshipped, a white peak<br />
Of Purity, and a stern voice pealing doom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Not the mad voice of old&mdash;which pierced so deep<br />
Within my life, that with the reeking blade<br />
Wet with the heart's blood of my child I smote<br />
My guilty heart in twain.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">Ah! fool, to dream<br />
That the long stain of time might fade and merge<br />
In one poor chrism of blood. They taught of yore,<br />
My priests who flattered me&mdash;nor knew at all<br />
The greater God I know, who sits afar<br />
Beyond those earthly shapes, passionless, pure,<br />
And awful as the Dawn&mdash;that the gods cared<br />
For costly victims, drinking in the steam<br />
Of sacrifice when the choice hecatombs<br />
Were offered for my wrong. Ah no! there is<br />
No recompense in these, nor any charm<br />
To cleanse the stain of sin, but the long wear<br />
Of suffering, when the soul which seized too much<br />
Of pleasure here, grows righteous by the pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span><br />
That doth redress its ill. For what is Right<br />
But equipoise of Nature, alternating<br />
The Too Much and Too Little? Not on earth<br />
The salutary silent forces work<br />
Their final victory, but year on year<br />
Passes, and age on age, and leaves the debt<br />
Unsatisfied, while the o'erburdened soul<br />
Unloads itself in pain.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">Therefore it is<br />
I suffer as I suffered ere swift death<br />
Set me not free, no otherwise; and yet<br />
There comes a healing purpose in my pain<br />
I never knew on earth; nor ever here<br />
The once-loved evil grows, only the tale<br />
Of penalties grown greater hourly dwarfs<br />
The accomplished sum of wrong. And yet desire<br />
Pursues me still&mdash;sick, impotent desire,<br />
Fiercer than that of earth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i28">We are ourselves<br />
Our heaven and hell, the joy, the penalty,<br />
The yearning, the fruition. Earth is hell<br />
Or heaven, and yet not only earth; but still,<br />
After the swift soul leaves the gates of death,<br />
The pain grows deeper and less mixed, the joy<br />
Purer and less alloyed, and we are damned<br />
Or blest, as we have lived."</p>

<p class="v0 i29">He ceased, with a wail<br />
Like some complaining wind among the pines<br />
Or pent among the fretful ocean caves,<br />
A sick, sad sound.</p>

<p class="v0 i19">Then as I looked, I saw<br />
His eyes glare horribly, his dry parched lips<br />
Open, his weary hands stretch idly forth<br />
As if to clutch the air&mdash;infinite pain<br />
And mockery of hope. "Seest thou them now?"<br />
He said. "I thirst, I parch, I famish, yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span><br />
They still elude me, fair and tempting fruit<br />
And cooling waters. Now they come again.<br />
See, they are in my grasp, they are at my lips,<br />
Now I shall quench me. Nay, again they fly<br />
And mock me. Seest thou them, or am I shut<br />
From hope for ever, hungering, thirsting still,<br />
A madman and in Hell?"</p>

<p class="v0 i23">And as I passed<br />
In horror, his large eyes and straining hands<br />
Froze all my soul with pity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i29">Then it was<br />
A woman whom I saw: a dark pale Queen,<br />
With passion in her eyes, and fear and pain<br />
Holding her steadfast gaze, like one who sees<br />
Some dreadful deed of wrong worked out and knows<br />
Himself the cause, yet now is powerless<br />
To stay the wrong he would.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">Seeing me gaze<br />
In pity on her woe, she turned and spake<br />
With a low wailing voice&mdash;</p>

<p class="v0 i27">"Thou well mayst gaze<br />
With horror on me, sir, for I am lost;<br />
I have shed the innocent blood, long years ago,<br />
Nay, centuries of pain. I have shed the blood<br />
Of him I loved, and found for recompense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span><br />
But self-inflicted death and age-long woe,<br />
Which purges not my sin. And yet not I<br />
It was who did it, but the gods, who took<br />
A woman's loveless heart and tortured it<br />
With love as with a fire. It was not I<br />
Who slew my love, but Fate. Fate 'twas which brought<br />
My love and me together, Fate which barred<br />
The path of blameless love, yet set Love's flame<br />
To burn and smoulder in a hopeless heart,<br />
Where no relief might come.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">The King was old,<br />
And I a girl. 'Tis an old tale which runs<br />
Thro' the sad ages, and 'twas mine. He had spent<br />
His sum of love long since, and I&mdash;I knew not<br />
A breath of Love as yet. Ah, it is strange<br />
To lose the sense of maidenhood, drink deep<br />
Of life to the very dregs, and yet not know<br />
A flutter of Love's wing. Love takes no thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span><br />
For pomp, or palace, or respect of men;<br />
Nor always in the stately marriage bed,<br />
Closed round by silken curtains, laid on down,<br />
Nestles a rosy form; but 'mid wild flowers<br />
Or desert tents, or in the hind's low cot,<br />
Beneath the aspect of the unconscious stars,<br />
Dwells all night and is blest.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">My love, my life!<br />
He was the old man's son, a fair white soul&mdash;<br />
Not like the others, whom the fire of youth<br />
Burns like a flame and hurries unrestrained<br />
Thro' riotous days and nights, but virginal<br />
And pure as any maid. No wandering glance<br />
He deigned for all the maidens young and fair<br />
Who sought their Prince's eye. But evermore,<br />
Upon the high lawns wandering alone,<br />
He dwelt unwed; weaving to Artemis,<br />
Fairest of all Olympian maids, a wreath<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span><br />
From the unpolluted meads, where never herd<br />
Drives his white flock, nor ever scythe has come,<br />
But the bee sails upon unfettered wing<br />
Over the spring-like lawns, and Purity<br />
Waters them with soft dews;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> and yet he showed<br />
Of all his peers most manly&mdash;heart and soul<br />
A very man, tender and true, and strong<br />
And pitiful, and in his limbs and mien<br />
Fair as Apollo's self.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">It was at first<br />
In Tr&oelig;zen that I saw him, when he came<br />
To greet his sire. Amid the crowd of youths<br />
He showed a Prince indeed; yet knew I not<br />
Whom 'twas I saw, nor that I held the place<br />
Which was his mother's, only from the throng<br />
Love, with a barbed dart aiming, pierced my heart<br />
Ere yet I knew what ailed me. Every glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span><br />
Fired me; the youthful grace, the tall straight limbs,<br />
The swelling sinewy arms, the large dark eyes<br />
Tender yet full of passion, the thick locks<br />
Tossed from his brow, the lip and cheek which bore<br />
The down of early manhood, seemed to feed<br />
My heart with short-lived joy.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">For when he stood<br />
Forth from the throng and knelt before his sire,<br />
Then raised his eyes to mine, I felt the curse<br />
Of Aphrodité burn me, as it burned<br />
My mother before me, and I dared not meet<br />
His innocent, frank young eyes.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">Said I then young?<br />
Ay, but not young as mine. For I had known<br />
The secret things of life, which age the soul<br />
In a moment, writing on its front their mark<br />
'Too early ripe;' and he was innocent,<br />
My spouse in fitted years, within whose arms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span><br />
I had defied the world.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">I turned away<br />
Like some white bird that leaves the flock, which sails<br />
High in mid air above the haunts of men,<br />
Feeling some little dart within her breast,<br />
Not death, but like to death, and slowly sinks<br />
Down to the earth alone, and bears her hurt<br />
Unseen, by herbless sand and bitter pool,<br />
And pines until the end.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">Even from that day<br />
I strove to gain his love. Nay, 'twas not I,<br />
But the cruel gods who drove me. Day by day<br />
We were together; for in days of old<br />
Women were free, not pent in gilded jails<br />
As afterwards, but free to walk alone,<br />
For good or evil, free. I hardly took<br />
Thought for my spouse, the King. For I had found<br />
My love at last: what matter if it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span><br />
A guilty love? Yet love is love indeed,<br />
Stronger than heaven or hell. Day after day<br />
I set myself to tempt him from his proud<br />
And innocent way, for I had spurned aside<br />
Care for the gods or men&mdash;all but my love.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">What need to tell the tale? Was it a sigh,<br />
A blush, a momentary glance, which brought<br />
Assurance of my triumph? It is long<br />
Since I have lived, I cannot tell; I know<br />
Only the penalty of death and hell<br />
Which followed on my sin. I knew he loved.<br />
It was not wonderful, seeing that we dwelt<br />
A boy and girl together. I was fair,<br />
And Eros fired my eyes and lent my voice<br />
His own soft tremulous tones. But when our souls<br />
Trembled upon the verge, and fancy feigned<br />
His arms around me as we fled alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span><br />
To some free land of exile, lo! a scroll:<br />
'Dearest, it may not be; I fear the Gods;<br />
We dare not do this wrong. I go from hence<br />
And see thy face no more. Farewell! Forget<br />
The love we may not own; go, seek for both<br />
Forgiveness from the gods.'</p>

<p class="v0 i28">When I read the words,<br />
The cruel words, methought my heart stood still,<br />
And when the ebbing life returned I seemed<br />
To have lost all thought of Love. Only Revenge<br />
Dwelt with me still, the fiercer that I knew<br />
My long-prized hope, which came so near success,<br />
Snatched from me and for ever.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">When I rose<br />
From my deep swoon, I bade a messenger<br />
Go, seek the King for me. He came and sate<br />
Beside my couch, and all the doors were closed,<br />
And all withdrawn. Then with the liar's art,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span><br />
And hypocrite tears, and feigned reluctancy,<br />
And all the subtle wiles a woman draws<br />
From the armoury of hate, I did instil<br />
The poison to his soul. Cunning devices,<br />
Feigned sorrow, mention of his son, regrets,<br />
And half confessions&mdash;these, with hateful skill<br />
Confused together, drove the old man's soul<br />
To frenzy; and I watched him, with a sneer,<br />
Turn to a dotard thirsting for the life<br />
Of his own child. But how to do the deed,<br />
Yet shed no blood, nor know the people's hate,<br />
Who loved the Prince, I knew not.</p>

<p class="v0 i34">Till one day<br />
The old man, looking out upon the sea,<br />
Besought the dread Poseidon to avenge<br />
The treachery of his son. Even as we stood<br />
Gazing upon the breathless blue, a cloud<br />
Rose from the deep, a little fleecy cloud,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span><br />
Which sudden grew and grew, and turned the blue<br />
To purple; and a swift wind rose and sang<br />
Higher and higher, and the wine-dark sea<br />
Grew ruffled, and within the circling bay<br />
The tiny ripples, stealing up the sand,<br />
Plunged loud with manes of foam, until they swelled<br />
To misty surges thundering on the shore.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then at the old man's elbow as I stood,<br />
A deep dark thought, sent by the powers of ill,<br />
Answering, as now I know, my own black hate<br />
And not my poor dupe's anger, fired my soul<br />
And bade me speak. 'The god has heard thy prayer,'<br />
I whispered; 'See the surge which wakes and swells<br />
To fury; well I know what things shall be.<br />
It is Poseidon's voice sounds in the storm<br />
And sends thy vengeance. Young Hippolytus<br />
Loves, as thou knowest, on the yellow sand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span><br />
Hard by the rippled margin of the wave,<br />
To urge his flying steeds. Bid him go forth&mdash;<br />
He will obey&mdash;and see what recompense<br />
The god will send his wrong.'</p>

<p class="v0 i30">In the old man's eyes<br />
A watery gleam of malice played awhile&mdash;<br />
I hated him for it&mdash;and he bade his son<br />
Drive forth his chariot on the sand, and yoke<br />
His three young fiery steeds.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">And still the storm<br />
Blew fiercer and more fierce, and the white crests<br />
Plunged on the strand, and the high promontories<br />
Resounded counter-stricken, and a mist<br />
Of foam, blown landward, hid the sounding shore.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then saw I him come forth and bid them yoke<br />
His untamed colts. I had not seen his face<br />
Since that last day, but, seeing him, I felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span><br />
The old love spring anew, yet mixed with hate&mdash;<br />
A storm of warring passions. Tho' I knew<br />
What end should come, yet would I speak no word<br />
That might avert it. The old man looked forth;<br />
I think he had well-nigh forgotten all<br />
The wrong he fancied and the doom he prayed,<br />
All but the father's pride in the strong son,<br />
Who was so young and bold. I saw a smile<br />
Upon the dotard's face, when now the steeds<br />
Were harnessed and the chariot, on the sand<br />
Along the circling margin of the bay,<br />
Flew, swift as light. A sudden gleam of sun<br />
Flashed on the silver harness as it went,<br />
Burned on the brazen axles of the wheels,<br />
And on the golden fillets of the Prince<br />
Doubled the gold. Sometimes a larger wave<br />
Would dash in mist around him, and in fear<br />
The rearing coursers plunged, and then again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span><br />
The strong young arm constrained them, and they flashed<br />
To where the wave-worn foreland ends the bay.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And then he turned his chariot, a bright speck<br />
Now seen, now hidden, but always, tho' the surge<br />
Broke round it, safe; emerging like a star<br />
From the white clouds of foam. And as I watched,<br />
Speaking no word, and breathing scarce a breath,<br />
I saw the firm limbs strongly set apart<br />
Upon the chariot, and the reins held high,<br />
And the proud head bent forward, with long locks<br />
Streaming behind, as nearer and more near<br />
The swift team rushed&mdash;until, with a half joy,<br />
It seemed as if my love might yet elude<br />
The slow sure anger of the god, dull wrath<br />
Swayed by a woman's lie.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">But on the verge,<br />
As I cast my eyes, a vast and purple wall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span><br />
Swelled swiftly towards the land; the lesser waves<br />
Sank as it came, and to its toppling crest<br />
The spume-flecked waters, from the strand drawn back,<br />
Left dry the yellow shore. Onward it came,<br />
Hoarse, capped with breaking foam, lurid, immense,<br />
Rearing its dreadful height. The chariot sped<br />
Nearer and nearer. I could see my love<br />
With the light of victory in his eyes, the smile<br />
Of daring on his lips: so near he came<br />
To where the marble palace-wall confined<br />
The narrow strip of beach&mdash;his brave young eyes<br />
Fixed steadfast on the goal, in the pride of life,<br />
Without a thought of death. I strove to cry,<br />
But terror choked my breath. Then, like a bull<br />
Upon the windy level of the plain<br />
Lashing himself to rage, the furious wave,<br />
Poising itself a moment, tossing high<br />
Its wind-vexed crest, dashed downward on the strand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span><br />
With a stamp, with a rush, with a roar.</p>

<p class="v0 i40">And when I looked,<br />
The shore, the fields, the plain, were one white sea<br />
Of churning, seething foam&mdash;chariot and steeds<br />
Gone, and my darling on the wave's white crest<br />
Tossed high, whirled down, beaten, and bruised, and flung,<br />
Dying upon the marble.</p>

<p class="v1 i23">My great love<br />
Sprang up redoubled, and cast out my hate<br />
And spurned all thought of fear; and down the stair<br />
I hurried, and upon the bleeding form<br />
I threw myself, and raised his head, and clasped<br />
His body to mine, and kissed him on the lips,<br />
And in his dying ear confessed my wrong,<br />
And saw the horror in his dying eyes<br />
And knew that I was damned. And when he breathed<br />
His last pure breath, I rose and slowly spake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Turned to a Fury now by love and pain&mdash;<br />
To the old man who knelt, while all the throng<br />
Could hear my secret: 'See, thou fool, I am<br />
The murderess of thy son, and thou my dupe,<br />
Thou and thy gods. See, he was innocent;<br />
I murdered him for love. I scorn ye all,<br />
Thee and thy gods together, who are deceived<br />
By a woman's lying tongue! Oh, doting fool,<br />
To hate thy own! And ye, false powers, which punish<br />
The innocent, and let the guilty soul<br />
Escape unscathed, I hate ye all&mdash;I curse,<br />
I loathe you!'</p>

<p class="v0 i15">Then I stooped and kissed my love,<br />
And left them in amaze; and up the stair<br />
Swept slowly to my chamber, and therein,<br />
Hating my life and cursing men and gods,<br />
I did myself to death.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">But even here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span><br />
I find my punishment. Oh, dreadful doom<br />
Of souls like mine! To see their evil done<br />
Always before their eyes, the one dread scene<br />
Of horror. See, the dark wave on the verge<br />
Towers horrible, and he&mdash;&mdash; Oh, Love, my Love!<br />
Safety is near! quick! quicker! urge them on!<br />
Thou wilt 'scape it yet!&mdash;Nay, nay, it bursts on him!<br />
I have shed the innocent blood! Oh, dreadful gaze<br />
Within his glazing eyes! Hide them, ye gods!<br />
Hide them! I cannot bear them. Quick! a dagger!<br />
I will lose their glare in death. Nay, die I cannot;<br />
I must endure and live&mdash;Death brings not peace<br />
To the lost souls in Hell."</p>

<p class="v0 i28">And her eyes stared,<br />
Rounded with horror, and she stooped and gazed<br />
So eagerly, and pressed her fevered hands<br />
Upon her trembling forehead with such pain<br />
As drives the gazer mad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i25">Then as I passed,<br />
I marked against the hardly dawning sky<br />
A toilsome figure standing, bent and strained,<br />
Before a rocky mass, which with great pain<br />
And agony of labour it would thrust<br />
Up a steep hill. But when upon the crest<br />
It poised a moment, then I held my breath<br />
With dread, for, lo! the poor feet seemed to clutch<br />
The hillside as in fear, and the poor hands<br />
With hopeless fingers pressed into the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span><br />
In agony, and the limbs stiffened, and a cry<br />
Like some strong swimmer's, whom the mightier stream<br />
Sweeps downward, and he sees his children's eyes<br />
Upon the bank; broke from him; and at last,<br />
After long struggles of despair, the limbs<br />
Relaxed, and as I closed my fearful eyes,<br />
Seeing the inevitable doom&mdash;a crash,<br />
A horrible thunderous noise, as down the steep<br />
The shameless fragment leapt. From crag to crag<br />
It bounded ever swifter, striking fire<br />
And wrapt in smoke, as to the lowest depths<br />
Of the vale it tore, and seemed to take with it<br />
The miserable form whose painful gaze<br />
I caught, as with the great rock whirled and dashed<br />
Downward, and marking every crag with gore<br />
And long gray hairs, it plunged, yet living still,<br />
To the black hollow; and then a silence came<br />
More dreadful than the noise, and a low groan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span><br />
Was all that I could hear.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">When to the foot<br />
Of the dark steep I hurried, half in hope<br />
To find the victim dead&mdash;not recognizing<br />
The undying life of Hell&mdash;I seemed to see<br />
An aged man, bruised, bleeding, with gray hairs,<br />
And eyes from which the cunning leer of greed<br />
Was scarcely yet gone out.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">A crafty voice<br />
It was that answered me, the voice of guile<br />
Part purified by pain:</p>

<p class="v0 i23">"There comes not death<br />
To those who live in Hell, nor hardly pause<br />
Of suffering longer than may serve to make<br />
The pain renewed, more piercing. Long ago,<br />
I thought that I had cheated Death, and now<br />
I seek him; but he comes not, nor know I<br />
If ever he will hear me. Whence art thou?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span><br />
Comest thou from earthly air, or whence? What power<br />
Has brought thee hither? For I know indeed<br />
Thou art not lost as I; for never here<br />
I look upon a human face, nor see<br />
The ghosts who doubtless here on every side<br />
Suffer a common pain, only at times<br />
I hear the echo of a shriek far off,<br />
Like some faint ghost of woe which fills the pause<br />
And interval of suffering; but from whom<br />
The voice may come, or whence, I know not, only<br />
The air teems with vague pain, which doth distract<br />
The ear when for a moment comes surcease<br />
Of agony, and the sense of effort spent<br />
In vain and fruitless labour, and the pang<br />
Of long-deferred defeat, which waits and takes<br />
The world-worn heart, and maddens it when all&mdash;<br />
Heaven, conscience, happiness, are staked and lost<br />
For gains which still elude it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i32">Yet 'twas sweet,<br />
A King in early youth, when pleasure is sweet,<br />
To live the fair successful years, and know<br />
The envy and respect of men. I cared<br />
For none of youth's delights: the dance, the song,<br />
Allured me not; the smooth soft ways of sense<br />
Tempted me not at all. I could despise<br />
The follies that I shared not, spending all<br />
The long laborious days in toilsome schemes<br />
To compass honour and wealth, and, as I grew<br />
In name and fame, finding my hoarded gains<br />
Transmuted into Power. The seas were white<br />
With laden argosies, and all were mine.<br />
The sheltering moles defied the wintry storms,<br />
And all were mine. The marble aqueducts,<br />
The costly bridges, all were mine. Fair roads<br />
Wound round and round the hills&mdash;my work. The gods<br />
Alone I heeded not, nor cared at all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span><br />
For aught but that my eyes and ears might take,<br />
Spurning invisible things, nor built I to them<br />
Temple or shrine, wrapt up in life, set round<br />
With earthly blessings like a god. I rose<br />
To such excess of weal and fame and pride,<br />
My people held me god-like. I grew drunk<br />
With too great power, scoffing at men and gods,<br />
Careless of both, but not averse to fling<br />
To those too weak themselves, what benefits<br />
My larger wisdom spurned.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">Then suddenly<br />
I knew the pain of failure. Summer storms<br />
Sucked down my fleets even within sight of port.<br />
A grievous blight wasted the harvest-fields,<br />
Mocking my hopes of gain. Wars came and drained<br />
My store, and I grew needy, knowing now<br />
The hell of stronger souls, the loss of power<br />
Wherein they exulted once. There comes no pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span><br />
Deeper than to have known delight of power,<br />
And then to lose it all. But I, I would not<br />
Sit tame beneath defeat, trimming my sails<br />
To wait the breeze of Fortune&mdash;fickle breath<br />
Which perhaps might breathe no more&mdash;but chose instead<br />
By rash conceit and bolder enterprise<br />
To win her aid again. I had no thought<br />
Of selfish gain, only to be and act<br />
As a god to those, feeding my sum of pride<br />
With acted good.</p>

<p class="v0 i17">But evermore defeat<br />
Dogged me, and evermore my people grew<br />
To doubt me, seeing no more the wealth, the force,<br />
Which once they worshipped. Then the lust of power<br />
Loved, not for sake of others, but itself,<br />
Grew on me, and the pride which can dare all,<br />
Save failure only, seized me. Evil finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span><br />
Its ready chance. There were rich argosies<br />
Upon the seas: I sank them, ship and crew,<br />
In the unbetraying ocean. Wayfarers<br />
Crossing the passes with rich merchandise<br />
My creatures, hid behind the crags, o'erwhelmed<br />
With rocks hurled downward. Yet I spent my gains<br />
For the public weal, not otherwise; and they,<br />
The careless people, took the piteous spoils<br />
Which cost the lives of many, and a man's soul,<br />
And blessed the giver. Empty venal blessings,<br />
Which sting more deep than curses!</p>

<p class="v0 i35">For awhile<br />
I was content with this, but at the last<br />
A great contempt and hatred of them took me,<br />
The base, vile churls! Why should I stain my soul<br />
For such as those&mdash;dogs that would fawn and lick<br />
The hand that fed them, but, if food should fail,<br />
Would turn and rend me? I would none of them;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span><br />
I would grow rich and happy, being indeed<br />
Godlike in brain to such. So with all craft,<br />
And guile, and violence I enriched me, loading<br />
My treasuries with gold. My deep-laid schemes<br />
Of gain engrossed the long laborious days,<br />
Stretched far into the night. Enjoy, I might not,<br />
Seeing it was all to do, and life so brief<br />
That ere a man might gain the goal he would,<br />
Lo! Age, and with it Death, and so an end!<br />
For all the tales of the indignant gods,<br />
What were they but the priests'? I had myself<br />
Broken all oaths; long time deceived and ruined<br />
With every phase of fraud the pious fools<br />
Whom oath-sworn Justice bound; battened on blood<br />
And what was I the worse? How should the gods<br />
Bear rule if I were happy? Death alone<br />
Was certain. Therefore must I haste to heap<br />
Treasure sufficient for my need, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span><br />
Enjoy the gathered good.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">But gradually<br />
There came&mdash;not great disasters which might crush<br />
All hope, but petty checks which did decrease<br />
My store, and left my labour vain, and me<br />
Unwilling to enjoy; and gradually<br />
I felt the chill approach of age, which stole<br />
Higher and higher on me, till the life,<br />
As in a paralytic, left my limbs<br />
And heart, and mounted upwards to my brain,<br />
Its last resort, and rested there awhile<br />
Ere it should spread its wings. But even thus,<br />
Tho' powerless to enjoy, the insatiate greed<br />
And thirst of power sustained me, and supplied<br />
Life's spark with some scant fuel, till it seemed,<br />
Year after year, as if I could not die,<br />
Holding so fast to life. I grew so old<br />
That all the comrades of my youth, my prime,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span><br />
My age, were gone, and I was left alone<br />
With those who knew me not, bereft of all<br />
Except my master passion&mdash;an old man<br />
Forlorn, forgotten of the gods and Death.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">So all the people, seeing me grow old<br />
And prosperous, held me wise, and spread abroad<br />
Strange fables, growing day by day more strange&mdash;<br />
How I deceived the very gods. They thought<br />
That I was blest, remembering not the wear<br />
Of anxious thought, the growing sum of pain,<br />
The failing ear and eye, the slower limbs,<br />
Whose briefer name is Age: and yet I trow<br />
I was not all unhappy, though I knew<br />
It was too late to enjoy, and though my store<br />
Increased not as my greed&mdash;nay, even sunk down<br />
A little, year by year. Till, last of all,<br />
When now my time was come and I had grown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span><br />
A little tired of living, a trivial hurt<br />
Laid me upon my bed; and as I mused<br />
On my long life and all its villanies,<br />
The wickedness I did, the blood I shed,<br />
The guile, the frauds of years&mdash;they came with news,<br />
One now, and now another; how my schemes<br />
Were crushed, my enterprises lost, my toil<br />
And labour all in vain. Day after day<br />
They brought these tidings, while I longed to rise<br />
And stay the tide of ill, and raved to know<br />
I could not. At the last the added sum<br />
Of evil, like yon great rock poised awhile<br />
Uncertain, gathered into one, o'erwhelmed<br />
My feeble strength, and left me ruined and lost,<br />
And showed me all I was, and all the depth<br />
And folly of my sin, and racked my brain,<br />
And sank me in despair and misery,<br />
And broke my heart and slew me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i32">Therefore 'tis<br />
I spend the long, long centuries which have come<br />
Between me and my sin, in such dread tasks<br />
As that thou sawest. In the soul I sinned:<br />
In body and soul I suffer. What I bade<br />
My minions do to others, that of woe<br />
I bear myself; and in the pause of ill,<br />
As now, I know again the bitter pang<br />
Of failure, which of old pierced thro' my soul<br />
And left me to despair. The pain of mind<br />
Is fiercer far than any bodily ill,<br />
And both are mine&mdash;the pang of torture-pain<br />
Always recurring; and, far worse, the pang<br />
Of consciousness of black sins sinned in vain&mdash;<br />
The doom of constant failure.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Will, fierce Will!<br />
Thou parent of unrest and toil and woe,<br />
Measureless effort! growing day by day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span><br />
To force strong souls along the giddy steep<br />
That slopes to the pit of Hell, where effort serves<br />
Only to speed destruction! Yet I know<br />
Thou art not, as some hold, the primal curse<br />
Which doth condemn us; since thou bearest in thee<br />
No power to satisfy thyself; but rather,<br />
The spring of act, whereby in earth and heaven<br />
Both men and gods do breathe and live and are,<br />
Since Life is Act and not to Do is Death&mdash;<br />
I do not blame thee: but to work in vain<br />
Is bitterest penalty: to find at last<br />
The soul all fouled with sin and stained with blood<br />
In vain; ah, this is hell indeed&mdash;the hell<br />
Of lost and striving souls!"</p>

<p class="v0 i29">Then as I passed,<br />
The halting figure bent itself again<br />
To the old task, and up the rugged steep<br />
Thrust the great rock with groanings. Horror chained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span><br />
My parting footsteps, like a nightmare dream<br />
Which holds us that we flee not, with wide eyes<br />
That loathe to see, yet cannot choose but gaze<br />
Till all be done. Slowly, with dreadful toil<br />
And struggle and strain, and bleeding hands and knees,<br />
And more than mortal strength, against the hill<br />
He pressed, the wretched one! till with long pain<br />
He trembled on the summit, a gaunt form,<br />
With that great rock above him, poised and strained,<br />
Now gaining, now receding, now in act<br />
To win the summit, now borne down again,<br />
And then the inevitable crash&mdash;the mass<br />
Leaping from crag to crag. But ere it ceased<br />
In dreadful silence, and the low groan came,<br />
My limbs were loosed with one convulsive bound;<br />
I hid my face within my hands, and fled,<br />
Surfeit with horror<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i21">Then it was again<br />
A woman whom I saw, pitiless, stern,<br />
Bearing the brand of blood&mdash;a lithe dark form,<br />
And cruel eyes which glared beneath the gems<br />
That argued her a Queen, and on her side<br />
An ancient stain of gore, which did befoul<br />
Her royal robe. A murderess in thought<br />
And dreadful act, who took within the toils<br />
Her kingly Lord, and slew him of old time<br />
After burnt Troy. I had no time to speak<br />
When she shrieked thus:</p>

<p class="v0 i24">"It doth repent me not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span><br />
I would 'twere yet to do, and I would do it<br />
Again a thousand times, if the shed blood<br />
Might for one hour restore me to the kisses<br />
Of my Ægisthus. Oh, he was divine,<br />
My hero, with the godlike locks and eyes<br />
Of Eros' self! What boots it that they prate<br />
Of wifely duty, love of spouse or child,<br />
Honour or pity, when the swift fire takes<br />
A woman's heart, and burns it out, and leaps<br />
With fierce forked tongue around it, till it lies<br />
In ashes, a dead heart, nor aught remains<br />
Of old affections, naught but the new flame<br />
Which is unquenched desire?</p>

<p class="v0 i28">It did not come,<br />
My blessing, all at once, but the slow fruit<br />
Of solitude and midnight loneliness,<br />
And weary waiting for the tardy news<br />
Of taken Troy. Long years I sate alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span><br />
Widowed, within my palace, while my Lord<br />
Was over seas, waging the accursèd war,<br />
First of the file of Kings. Year after year<br />
Came false report, or harder, no report<br />
Of the great fleet. The summers waxed and waned,<br />
The wintry surges smote the sounding shores,<br />
And yet there came no end of it. They brought<br />
Now hopeless failure, now great victories;<br />
And all alike were false, all but delay<br />
And hope deferred, which cometh not, but breaks<br />
The heart which suffering wrings not.</p>

<p class="v0 i38">So I bore<br />
Long time the solitary years, and sought<br />
To solace the dull days with motherly cares<br />
For those my Lord had left me. My firstborn,<br />
Iphigeneia, sailed at first with him<br />
Upon that fatal voyage, but the young<br />
Orestes and Electra stayed with me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Not dear as she was, for the firstborn takes<br />
The mother's heart, and, with the milk it draws<br />
From the mother's virgin breast, drains all the love<br />
It bore, ay, even tho' the sire be dear;<br />
Much more, then, when he is a King indeed,<br />
Mighty in war and council, but too high<br />
To stoop to a woman's love. But she was gone,<br />
Nor heard I tidings of her, knowing not<br />
If yet she walked the earth, nor if she bare<br />
The load of children, even as I had borne<br />
Her in my opening girlhood, when I leapt<br />
From child to Queen, but never loved the King.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Thus the slow years rolled onward, till at last<br />
There came a dreadful rumour&mdash;'She is dead,<br />
Thy daughter, years ago. The cruel priests<br />
Clamoured for blood; the stern cold Kings stood round<br />
Without a tear, and he, her sire, with them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span><br />
To see a virgin bleed. They cut with knives<br />
The taper girlish throat; they watched the blood<br />
Drip slowly on the sand, and the young life<br />
Meek as a lamb come to the sacrifice<br />
To appease the angry gods.' And he, the King,<br />
Her father, stood by too, and saw them do it,<br />
The wickedness, breathing no word of wrath,<br />
Till all was done! The cowards! the dull cowards!<br />
I would some black storm, bursting suddenly,<br />
Had whelmed them and their fleets, ere yet they dared<br />
To waste an innocent life!</p>

<p class="v0 i27">I had gone mad,<br />
I know it, but for him, my love, my dear,<br />
My fair sweet love. He came to comfort me<br />
With words of friendship, holding that my Lord<br />
Was bound, perhaps, to let her die&mdash;'The gods<br />
Were ofttimes hard to appease&mdash;or was it indeed<br />
The priests who asked it? Were there any gods?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span><br />
Or only phantoms, creatures of the brain,<br />
Born of the fears of men, the greed of priests,<br />
Useful to govern women? Had he been<br />
Lord of the fleet, not all the soothsayers<br />
Who ever frighted cowards should have brought<br />
His soul to such black depths.' I hearkening to him<br />
As 'twere my own thought grown articulate,<br />
Found my grief turn to hate, and hate to love&mdash;<br />
Hate of my Lord, love of the voice which spoke<br />
Such dear and comfortable words. And thus,<br />
Love to a storm of passion growing, swept<br />
My wounded soul and dried my tears, as dries<br />
The hot sirocco all the bitter pools<br />
Of salt among the sand. I never knew<br />
True love before; I was a child, no more,<br />
When the King cast his eyes on me. What is it<br />
To have borne the weight of offspring 'neath the zone,<br />
If Love be not their sire; or live long years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span><br />
Of commerce, not of love? Better a day<br />
Of Passion than the long unlovely years<br />
Of wifely duty, when Love cometh not<br />
To wake the barren days!</p>

<p class="v0 i25">And yet at first<br />
I hesitated long, nor would embrace<br />
The blessing that was mine. We are hedged round,<br />
We women, by such close-drawn ordinances,<br />
Set round us by our tyrants, that we fear<br />
To overstep a hand's breadth the dull bounds<br />
Of custom; but at last Love, waking in me,<br />
Burst all my chains asunder, and I lived<br />
For naught but Love.</p>

<p class="v0 i21">My son, the young Orestes,<br />
I sent far off; my girl Electra only<br />
Remained, too young to doubt me, and I knew<br />
At last what 'twas to live.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">So the swift years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><br />
Fleeted and found me happy, till the dark<br />
Ill-omened day when Rumour, thousand-tongued,<br />
Whispered of taken Troy; and from my dream<br />
Of happiness, sudden I woke, and knew<br />
The coming retribution. We had grown<br />
Too loving for concealment, and our tale<br />
Of mutual love was bruited far and wide<br />
Through Argos. All the gossips bruited it,<br />
And were all tongue to tell it to the King<br />
When he should come. And should the cold proud Lord<br />
I never loved, the murderer of my girl,<br />
Come 'twixt my love and me? A swift resolve<br />
Flashed through me pondering on it: Love for Love<br />
And Blood for Blood&mdash;the simple golden rule<br />
Taught by the elder gods.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">When I had taken<br />
My fixed resolve, I grew impatient for it,<br />
Counting the laggard days. Oh, it was sweet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span><br />
To simulate the yearning of a wife<br />
Long parted from her Lord, and mock the fools<br />
Who dogged each look and word, and but for fear<br />
Had torn me from my throne&mdash;the pies, the jays,<br />
The impotent chatterers, who thought by words<br />
To stay me in the act! 'Twas sweet to mock them<br />
And read distrust within their eyes, when I,<br />
Knowing my purpose, bade them quick prepare<br />
All fitting honours for the King, and knew<br />
They dared not disobey&mdash;oh, 'twas enough<br />
To wing the slow-paced hours.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">But when at last<br />
I saw his sails upon the verge, and then<br />
The sea-worn ship, and marked his face grown old,<br />
The body a little bent, which was so straight,<br />
The thin gray hairs which were the raven locks<br />
Of manhood when he went, I felt a moment<br />
I could not do the deed. But when I saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span><br />
The beautiful sad woman come with him,<br />
The future in her eyes, and her sad voice<br />
Proclaimed the tale of doom, two thoughts at once<br />
Assailed me, bidding me despatch with a blow<br />
Him and his mistress, making sure the will<br />
Of fate, and my revenge.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">Oh, it was strange<br />
To see all happen as we planned; as 'twere<br />
Some drama oft rehearsed, wherein each step,<br />
Each word, is so prepared, the poorest player<br />
Knows his turn come to do&mdash;the solemn landing&mdash;<br />
The ride to the palace gate&mdash;the courtesies<br />
Of welcome&mdash;the mute crowds without&mdash;the bath<br />
Prepared within&mdash;the precious circling folds<br />
Of tissue stretched around him, shutting out<br />
The gaze, and folding helpless like a net<br />
The mighty limbs&mdash;the battle-axe laid down<br />
Against the wall, and I, his wife and Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span><br />
Alone with him, waiting and watching still,<br />
Till the woman shrieked without. Then with swift step<br />
I seized the axe, and struck him as he lay<br />
Helpless, once, twice, and thrice&mdash;once for my girl,<br />
Once for my love, once for the woman, and all<br />
For Fate and my Revenge!</p>

<p class="v0 i25">He gave a groan,<br />
Once only, as I thought he might; and then<br />
No sound but the quick gurgling of the blood,<br />
As it flowed from him in streams, and turned the pure<br />
And limpid water of the bath to red&mdash;<br />
I had not looked for that&mdash;it flowed and flowed,<br />
And seemed to madden me to look on it,<br />
Until my love with hands bloody as mine,<br />
But with the woman's blood, rushed in, and eyes<br />
Rounded with horror; and we turned to go,<br />
And left the dead alone.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">But happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span><br />
Still mocked me, and a doubt unknown before<br />
Came on me, and amid the silken shows<br />
And luxury of power I seemed to see<br />
Another answer to my riddle of life<br />
Than that I gave myself, and it was 'murder;'<br />
And in my people's sullen mien and eyes,<br />
'Murder;' and in the mirror, when I looked,<br />
'Murder' glared out, and terror lest my son<br />
Returning, grown to manhood, should avenge<br />
His father's blood. For somehow, as 'twould seem,<br />
The gods, if gods there be, or the stern Fate<br />
Which doth direct our little lives, do filch<br />
Our happiness&mdash;though bright with Love's own ray,<br />
There comes a cloud which veils it. Yet, indeed,<br />
My days were happy. I repent me not;<br />
I would wade through seas of blood to know again<br />
Those fierce delights once more.</p>

<p class="v0 i33">But my young girl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span><br />
Electra, grown to woman, turned from me<br />
Her modest maiden eyes, nor loved to set<br />
Her kiss upon my cheek, but, all distraught<br />
With secret care, hid her from all the pomps<br />
And revelries which did befit her youth,<br />
Walking alone; and often at the tomb<br />
Of her lost sire they found her, pouring out<br />
Libations to the dead. And evermore<br />
I did bethink me of my son Orestes,<br />
Who now should be a man; and yearned sometimes<br />
To see his face, yet feared lest from his eyes<br />
His father's soul should smite me.</p>

<p class="v0 i35">So I lived<br />
Happy and yet unquiet&mdash;a stern voice<br />
Speaking of doom, which long time softer notes<br />
Of careless weal, the music that doth spring<br />
From the fair harmonies of life and love,<br />
Would drown in their own concord. This at times<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span><br />
Nay, day by day, stronger and dreadfuller,<br />
With dominant accent, marred the sounds of joy<br />
By one prevailing discord. So at length<br />
I came to lose the Present in the dread<br />
Of what might come; the penalty that waits<br />
Upon successful sin; who, having sinned,<br />
Had missed my sin's reward.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">Until one day<br />
I, looking from my palace casement, saw<br />
A humble suppliant, clad in pilgrim garb,<br />
Approach the marble stair. A sudden throb<br />
Thrilled thro' me, and the mother's heart went forth<br />
Thro' all disguise of garb and rank and years,<br />
Knowing my son. How fair he was, how tall<br />
And vigorous, my boy! What strong straight limbs<br />
And noble port! How beautiful the shade<br />
Of manhood on his lip! I longed to burst<br />
From my chamber down, yearning to throw myself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span><br />
Upon his neck within the palace court,<br />
Before the guards&mdash;spurning my queenly rank,<br />
All but my motherhood. And then a chill<br />
Of doubt o'erspread me, knowing what a gulf<br />
Fate set between our lives, impassable<br />
As that great gulf which yawns 'twixt life and death<br />
And 'twixt this Hell and Heaven. I shrank back,<br />
And turned to think a moment, half in fear,<br />
And half in pain; dividing the swift mind,<br />
Yet all in love.</p>

<p class="v0 i17">Then came a cry, a groan,<br />
From the inner court, the clash of swords, the fall<br />
Of a body on the pavement; and one cried,<br />
'The King is dead, slain by the young Orestes,<br />
Who cometh hither.' With the word, the door<br />
Flew open, and my son stood straight before me,<br />
His drawn sword dripping blood. Oh, he was fair<br />
And terrible to see, when from his limbs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span><br />
The suppliant's mantle fallen, left the mail<br />
And arms of a young warrior. Love and Hate,<br />
Which are the offspring of a common sire,<br />
Strove for the mastery, till within his eyes<br />
I saw his father's ghost glare unappeased<br />
From out Love's casements.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">Then I knew my fate<br />
And his&mdash;mine to be slain by my son's hand,<br />
And his to slay me, since the Furies drave<br />
Our lives to one destruction; and I took<br />
His point within my breast.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">But I praise not<br />
The selfish, careless gods who wrecked our lives,<br />
Making the King the murderer of his girl,<br />
And me his murderess; making my son<br />
The murderer of his mother and her love&mdash;<br />
A mystery of blood!&mdash;I curse them all,<br />
The careless Forces, sitting far withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span><br />
Upon the heights of Space, taking men's lives<br />
For playthings, and deriding as in sport<br />
Our happiness and woe&mdash;I curse them all.<br />
We have a right to joy; we have a right,<br />
I say, as they have. Let them stand confessed<br />
The puppets that they are&mdash;too weak to give<br />
The good they feign to love, since Fate, too strong<br />
For them as us, beyond their painted sky,<br />
Sits and derides them, too. I curse Fate too,<br />
The deaf blind Fury, taking human souls<br />
And crushing them, as a dull fretful child<br />
Crushes its toys and knows not with what skill<br />
Those feeble forms are feigned.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">I curse, I loathe,<br />
I spit on them. It doth repent me not.<br />
I would 'twere yet to do. I have lived my life.<br />
I have loved. See, there he lies within the bath,<br />
And thus I smite him! thus! Didst hear him groan?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span><br />
Oh, vengeance, thou art sweet! What, living still?<br />
Ah me! we cannot die! Come, torture me,<br />
Ye Furies&mdash;for I love not soothing words&mdash;<br />
As once ye did my son. Ye miserable<br />
Blind ministers of Hell, I do defy you;<br />
Not all your torments can undo the Past<br />
Of Passion and of Love!"</p>

<p class="v1 i25">Even as she spake<br />
There came a viewless trouble in the air,<br />
Which took her, and a sweep of wings unseen,<br />
And terrible sounds, which swooped on her and hushed<br />
Her voice, and seemed to occupy her soul<br />
With horror and despair; and as she passed<br />
I marked her agonized eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i28">But as I went,<br />
Full many a dreadful shape of lonely pain<br />
I saw. What need to tell them? We are filled<br />
Who live to-day with a more present sense<br />
Of the great love of God, than those of old<br />
Who, groping in the dawn of Knowledge, saw<br />
Only dark shadows of the Unknown; or he,<br />
First-born of modern singers, who swept deep<br />
His awful lyre, and woke the voice of song,<br />
Dumb for long centuries of pain. We dread<br />
To dwell on those long agonies its sin<br />
Brings on the offending soul; who hold a creed<br />
Of deeper Pity, knowing what chains of ill<br />
Bind round our petty lives. Each phase of woe,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span><br />
Suffering, and torture which the gloomy thought<br />
Of bigots feigns for others&mdash;all were there.<br />
One there was stretched upon a rolling wheel,<br />
Which was the barren round of sense, that still<br />
Returned upon itself and broke the limbs<br />
Bound to it day and night. Others I saw<br />
Doomed, with unceasing toil, to fill the urns<br />
Whose precious waters sank ere they could slake<br />
Their burning thirst. Another shapeless soul,<br />
Full of revolts and hates and tyrannous force,<br />
The weight of earth, which was its earth-born taint,<br />
Pressed groaning down, while with fierce beak and claw<br />
The vulture of remorse, piercing his breast,<br />
Preyed on his heart. For others, overhead,<br />
Great crags of rock impending seemed to fall,<br />
But fell not nor brought peace. I felt my soul<br />
Blunted with horrors, yearning to escape<br />
To where, upon the limits of the wood,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span><br />
Some scanty twilight grew.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">But ere I passed<br />
From those grim shades a deep voice sounded near,<br />
A voice without a form.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">"There is an end<br />
Of all things that thou seest! There is an end<br />
Of Wrong and Death and Hell! When the long wear<br />
Of Time and Suffering has effaced the stain<br />
Ingrown upon the soul, and the cleansed spirit,<br />
Long ages floating on the wandering winds<br />
Or rolling deeps of Space, renews itself<br />
And doth regain its dwelling, and, once more<br />
Blent with the general order, floats anew<br />
Upon the stream of Things,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> and comes at length,<br />
After new deaths, to that dim waiting-place<br />
Thou next shalt see, and with the justified<br />
White souls awaits the End; or, snatched at once,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span><br />
If Fate so will, to the pure sphere itself,<br />
Lives and is blest, and works the Eternal Work<br />
Whose name and end is Love! There is an end<br />
Of Wrong and Death and Hell!"</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Even as I heard,<br />
I passed from out the shadow of Death and Pain,<br />
Crying, "There is an end!"</p>

<p class="v4 i27">Then from those dark<br />
And dreadful precincts passing, ghostly fields<br />
And voiceless took me. A faint twilight veiled<br />
The leafless, shadowy trees and herbless plains.<br />
There stirred no breath of air to wake to life<br />
The slumbers of the world. The sky above<br />
Was one gray, changeless cloud. There looked no eye<br />
Of Life from the veiled heavens; but Sleep and Death<br />
Were round me everywhere. And yet no fear<br />
Nor horror took me here, where was no pain<br />
Nor dread, save that strange tremor which assails<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span><br />
One who in life's hot noontide looks on death<br />
And knows he too shall die. The ghosts which rose<br />
From every darkling copse showed thin and pale&mdash;<br />
Thinner and paler far than those I left<br />
In agony; even as Pity seems to wear<br />
A thinner form than Fear.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">Not caged alone<br />
Like those the avenging Furies purged were these,<br />
Nor that dim land as those black cavernous depths<br />
Where no hope comes. Fair souls were they and white<br />
Whom there I saw, waiting as we shall wait,<br />
The Beatific End, but thin and pale<br />
As the young faith which made them; touched a little<br />
By the sad memories of the earth; made glad<br />
A little by past joys: no more; and wrapt<br />
In musing on the brief play played by them<br />
Upon the lively earth, yet ignorant<br />
Of the long lapse of years, and what had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span><br />
Since they too breathed Life's air, or if they knew,<br />
Keeping some echo only; but their pain<br />
Was fainter than their joy, and a great hope<br />
Like ours possessed them dimly.</p>

<p class="v4 i32">First I saw<br />
A youth who pensive leaned against the trunk<br />
Of a dark cypress, and an idle flute<br />
Hung at his side. A sorrowful sad soul,<br />
Such as sometimes he knows, who meets the gaze,<br />
Mute, uncomplaining yet most pitiful,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><br />
Of one whom nature, by some secret spite,<br />
Has maimed and left imperfect; or the pain<br />
Which fills a poet's eyes. Beneath his robe<br />
I seemed to see the scar of cruel stripes,<br />
Too hastily concealed. Yet was he not<br />
Wholly unhappy, but from out the core<br />
Of suffering flowed a secret spring of joy,<br />
Which mocked the droughts of Fate, and left him glad<br />
And glorying in his sorrow. As I gazed<br />
He raised his silent flute, and, half ashamed,<br />
Blew a soft note; and as I stayed awhile<br />
I heard him thus discourse&mdash;</p>

<p class="v0 i29">"The flute is sweet<br />
To gods and men, but sweeter far the lyre<br />
And voice of a true singer. Shall I fear<br />
To tell of that great trial, when I strove<br />
And Ph&oelig;bus conquered? Nay, no shame it is<br />
To bow to an immortal melody;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span><br />
But glory.</p>

<p class="v0 i11">Once among the Phrygian hills<br />
I lay a-musing,&mdash;while the silly sheep<br />
Wandered among the thyme&mdash;upon the bank<br />
Of a clear mountain stream, beneath the pines,<br />
Safe hidden from the noon. A dreamy haze<br />
Played on the uplands, but the hills were clear<br />
In sunlight, and no cloud was on the sky.<br />
It was the time when a deep silence comes<br />
Upon the summer earth, and all the birds<br />
Have ceased from singing, and the world is still<br />
As midnight, and if any live thing move&mdash;<br />
Some fur-clad creature, or cool gliding snake&mdash;<br />
Within the pipy overgrowth of weeds,<br />
The ear can catch the rustle, and the trees<br />
And earth and air are listening. As I lay,<br />
Faintly, as in a dream, I seemed to hear<br />
A tender music, like the Æolian chords,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span><br />
Sound low within the woodland, whence the stream,<br />
Flowed full, yet silent. Long, with ear to ground,<br />
I hearkened; and the sweet strain, fuller grown,<br />
Rounder and clearer came, and danced along<br />
In mirthful measure now, and now grown grave<br />
In dying falls, and sweeter and more clear,<br />
Tripping at nuptials and high revelry,<br />
Wailing at burials, rapt in soaring thoughts,<br />
Chanting strange sea-tales full of mystery,<br />
Touching all chords of being, and life and death,<br />
Now rose, now sank, and always was divine,<br />
So strange the music came.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">Till, as I lay<br />
Enraptured, swift a sudden discord rang,<br />
And all the sound grew still. A sudden flash,<br />
As from a sunlit jewel, fired the wood.<br />
A noise of water smitten, and on the hills<br />
A fair white fleece of cloud, which swiftly climbed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span><br />
Into the farthest heaven. Then, as I mused,<br />
Knowing a parting goddess, straight I saw<br />
A sudden splendour float upon the stream,<br />
And knew it for this jewelled flute, which paused<br />
Before me on an eddy. It I snatched<br />
Eager, and to my ardent lips I bore<br />
The wonder, and behold, with the first breath&mdash;<br />
The first warm human breath, the silent strains.<br />
The half-drowned notes which late the goddess blew,<br />
Revived, and sounded clearer, sweeter far<br />
Than mortal skill could make. So with delight<br />
I left my flocks to wander o'er the wastes<br />
Untended, and the wolves and eagles seized<br />
The tender lambs, but I was for my art&mdash;<br />
Nought else; and though the high-pitched notes divine<br />
Grew faint, yet something lingered, and at last<br />
So sweet a note I sounded of my skill,<br />
That all the Phrygian highlands, all the white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span><br />
Hill villages, were fain to hear the strain,<br />
Which the mad shepherd made.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">So, overbold,<br />
And rapt in my new art, at last I dared<br />
To challenge Ph&oelig;bus' self.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">'Twas a fair day<br />
When sudden, on the mountain side, I saw<br />
A train of fleecy clouds in a white band<br />
Descending. Down the gleaming pinnacles<br />
And difficult crags they floated, and the arch,<br />
Drawn with its thousand rays against the sun,<br />
Hung like a glory o'er them. Midst the pines<br />
They clothed themselves with form, and straight I knew<br />
The immortals. Young Apollo, with his lyre,<br />
Kissed by the sun, and all the Muses clad<br />
In robes of gleaming white; then a great fear,<br />
Yet mixed with joy, assailed me, for I knew<br />
Myself a mortal equalled with the gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah me! how fair they were! how fair and dread<br />
In face and form, they showed, when now they came<br />
Upon the thymy slope, and the young god<br />
Lay with his choir around him, beautiful<br />
And bold as Youth and Dawn! There was no cloud<br />
Upon the sky, nor any sound at all<br />
When I began my strain. No coward fear<br />
Of what might come restrained me; but an awe<br />
Of those immortal eyes and ears divine<br />
Looking and listening. All the earth seemed full<br />
Of ears for me alone&mdash;the woods, the fields,<br />
The hills, the skies were listening. Scarce a sound<br />
My flute might make; such subtle harmonies<br />
The silence seemed to weave round me and flout<br />
The half unuttered thought. Till last I blew,<br />
As now, a hesitating note, and lo!<br />
The breath divine, lingering on mortal lips,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span><br />
Hurried my soul along to such fair rhymes,<br />
Sweeter than wont, that swift I knew my life<br />
Rise up within me, and expand, and all<br />
The human, which so nearly is divine,<br />
Was glorified, and on the Muses' lips,<br />
And in their lovely eyes, I saw a fair<br />
Approval, and my soul in me was glad.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For all the strains I blew were strains of love&mdash;<br />
Love striving, love triumphant, love that lies<br />
Within belovèd arms, and wreathes his locks<br />
With flowers, and lets the world go by and sings<br />
Unheeding; and I saw a kindly gleam<br />
Within the Muses' eyes, who were indeed,<br />
Women, though god-like.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">But upon the face<br />
Of the young Sun-god only haughty scorn<br />
Sate and he swiftly struck his golden lyre,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span><br />
And played the Song of Life; and lo, I knew<br />
My strain, how earthy! Oh, to hear the young<br />
Apollo playing! and the hidden cells<br />
And chambers of the universe displayed<br />
Before the charmèd sound! I seemed to float<br />
In some enchanted cave, where the wave dips<br />
In from the sunlit sea, and floods its depths<br />
With reflex hues of heaven. My soul was rapt<br />
By that I heard, and dared to wish no more<br />
For victory; and yet because the sound<br />
Of music that is born of human breath<br />
Comes straighter from the soul than any strain<br />
The hand alone can make; therefore I knew,<br />
With a mixed thrill of pity and delight,<br />
The nine immortal Sisters hardly touched<br />
By this fine strain of music, as by mine,<br />
And when the high lay trembled to its close,<br />
Still doubting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i16">Then upon the Sun-god's face<br />
There passed a cold proud smile. He swept his lyre<br />
Once more, then laid it down, and with clear voice,<br />
The voice of godhead, sang. Oh, ecstasy,<br />
Oh happiness of him who once has heard<br />
Apollo singing! For his ears the sound<br />
Of grosser music dies, and all the earth<br />
Is full of subtle undertones, which change<br />
The listener and transform him. As he sang&mdash;<br />
Of what I know not, but the music touched<br />
Each chord of being&mdash;I felt my secret life<br />
Stand open to it, as the parched earth yawns<br />
To drink the summer rain; and at the call<br />
Of those refreshing waters, all my thought<br />
Stir from its dark and secret depths, and burst<br />
Into sweet, odorous flowers, and from their wells<br />
Deep call to deep, and all the mystery<br />
Of all that is, laid open. As he sang,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span><br />
I saw the Nine, with lovely pitying eyes,<br />
Sign 'He has conquered.' Yet I felt no pang<br />
Of fear, only deep joy that I had heard<br />
Such music while I lived, even though it brought<br />
Torture and death. For what were it to lie<br />
Sleek, crowned with roses, drinking vulgar praise,<br />
And surfeited with offerings, the dull gift<br />
Of ignorant hands&mdash;all which I might have known&mdash;<br />
To this diviner failure? Godlike 'tis<br />
To climb upon the icy ledge, and fall<br />
Where other footsteps dare not. So I knew<br />
My fate, and it was near.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">For to a pine<br />
They bound me willing, and with cruel stripes<br />
Tore me, and took my life.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">But from my blood<br />
Was born the stream of song, and on its flow<br />
My poor flute, to the cool swift river borne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span><br />
Floated, and thence adown a lordlier tide<br />
Into the deep, wide sea. I do not blame<br />
Ph&oelig;bus, or Nature which has set this bar<br />
Betwixt success and failure, for I know<br />
How far high failure overleaps the bound<br />
Of low successes. Only suffering draws<br />
The inner heart of song and can elicit<br />
The perfumes of the soul. 'Twere not enough<br />
To fail, for that were happiness to him<br />
Who ever upward looks with reverent eye<br />
And seeks but to admire. So, since the race<br />
Of bards soars highest; as who seek to show<br />
Our lives as in a glass; therefore it comes<br />
That suffering weds with song, from him of old,<br />
Who solaced his blank darkness with his verse;<br />
Through all the story of neglect and scorn,<br />
Necessity, sheer hunger, early death,<br />
Which smite the singer still. Not only those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span><br />
Who keep clear accents of the voice divine<br />
Are honourable&mdash;they are happy, indeed,<br />
Whate'er the world has held&mdash;but those who hear<br />
Some fair faint echoes, though the crowd be deaf,<br />
And see the white gods' garments on the hills,<br />
Which the crowd sees not, though they may not find<br />
Fit music for their thought; they too are blest,<br />
Not pitiable. Not from arrogant pride<br />
Nor over-boldness fail they who have striven<br />
To tell what they have heard, with voice too weak<br />
For such high message. More it is than ease,<br />
Palace and pomp, honours and luxuries,<br />
To have seen white Presences upon the hills,<br />
To have heard the voices of the Eternal Gods."</p>

<p class="v1 i2">So spake he, and I seemed to look on him,<br />
Whose sad young eyes grow on us from the page<br />
Of his own verse: who did himself to death:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span><br />
Or whom the dullard slew: or whom the sea<br />
Rapt from us: and I passed without a word,<br />
Slow, grave, with many musings.</p>

<p class="v4 i32">Then I came<br />
On one a maiden, meek with folded hands,<br />
Seated against a rugged face of cliff,<br />
In silent thought. Anon she raised her arms,<br />
Her gleaming arms, above her on the rock,<br />
With hands which clasped each other, till she showed<br />
As in a statue, and her white robe fell<br />
Down from her maiden shoulders, and I knew<br />
The fair form as it seemed chained to the stone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span><br />
By some invisible gyves, and named her name:<br />
And then she raised her frightened eyes to mine<br />
As one who, long expecting some great fear,<br />
Scarce sees deliverance come. But when she saw<br />
Only a kindly glance, a softer look<br />
Came in them, and she answered to my thought<br />
With a sweet voice and low.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">"I did but muse<br />
Upon the painful past, long dead and done,<br />
Forgetting I was saved.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">The angry clouds<br />
Burst always on the low flat plains, and swept<br />
The harvest to the ocean; all the land<br />
Was wasted. A great serpent from the deep,<br />
Lifting his horrible head above their homes,<br />
Devoured the children. And the people prayed<br />
In vain to careless gods.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">On that dear land,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span><br />
Which now was turned into a sullen sea,<br />
Gazing in safety from the stately towers<br />
Of my sire's palace, I, a princess, saw,<br />
Lapt in soft luxury, within my bower<br />
The wreck of humble homes come whirling by,<br />
The drowning, bleating flocks, the bellowing herds,<br />
The grain scarce husbanded by toiling hands<br />
Upon the sunlit plain, rush to the sea,<br />
With floating corpses. On the rain-swept hills<br />
The remnant of the people huddled close,<br />
Homeless and starving. All my being was filled<br />
With pity for them, and I joyed to give<br />
What food and shelter and compassionate hands<br />
Of woman might. I took the little ones<br />
And clasped them shivering to the virgin breast<br />
Which knew no other touch but theirs, and gave<br />
Raiment and food. My sire, not stern to me,<br />
Smiled on me as he saw. My gentle mother,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span><br />
Who loved me with a closer love than binds<br />
A mother to her son; and sunned herself<br />
In my fresh beauty, seeing in my young eyes<br />
Her own fair vanished youth; doted on me,<br />
And fain had kept my eyes from the sad sights<br />
That pained them. But my heart was sad in me,<br />
Seeing the ineffable miseries of life,<br />
And that mysterious anger of the gods,<br />
And helpless to allay them. All in vain<br />
Were prayer and supplication, all in vain<br />
The costly victims steamed. The vengeful clouds<br />
Hid the fierce sky, and still the ruin came.<br />
And wallowing his grim length within the flood,<br />
Over the ravaged fields and homeless homes,<br />
The fell sea-monster raged, sating his jaws<br />
With blood and rapine.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">Then to the dread shrine<br />
Of Ammon went the priests, and reverend chiefs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span><br />
Of all the nation. White robed, at their head,<br />
Went slow my royal sire. The oracle<br />
Spoke clear, not as ofttimes in words obscure,<br />
Ambiguous. And as we stood to meet<br />
The suppliants&mdash;she who bare me, with her head<br />
Upon my neck&mdash;we cheerful and with song<br />
Welcomed their swift return; auguring well<br />
From such a quick-sped mission.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">But my sire<br />
Hid his face from me, and the crowd of priests<br />
And nobles looked not at us. And no word<br />
Was spoken till at last one drew a scroll<br />
And gave it to the queen, who straightway swooned,<br />
Having read it, on my breast, and then I saw,<br />
I the young girl whose soft life scarcely knew<br />
Shadow of sorrow, I whose heart was full<br />
Of pity for the rest, what doom was mine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">I think I hardly knew in that dread hour<br />
The fear that came anon; I was transformed<br />
Into a champion of my race, made strong<br />
With a new courage, glorying to meet,<br />
In all the ecstasy of sacrifice,<br />
Death face to face. Some god, I know not who,<br />
O'erspread me, and despite my mother's tears<br />
And my stern father's grief, I met my fate<br />
Unshrinking.</p>

<p class="v0 i13">When the moon rose clear from cloud<br />
Once more again over the midnight sea,<br />
And that vast watery plain, where were before<br />
Hundreds of happy homes, and well-tilled fields,<br />
And purple vineyards; from my father's towers<br />
The white procession went along the paths,<br />
The high cliff paths, which well I loved of old,<br />
Among the myrtles. Priests with censers went<br />
And offerings, robed in white, and round their brows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span><br />
The sacred fillet. With his nobles walked<br />
My sire with breaking heart. My mother clung<br />
To me the victim, and the young girls went<br />
With wailing and with tears. A solemn strain<br />
The soft flutes sounded, as we went by night<br />
To a wild headland, rock-based in the sea.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">There on a sea-worn rock, upon the verge,<br />
To some rude stanchions, high above my head,<br />
They bound me. Out at sea, a black reef rose,<br />
Washed by the constant surge, wherein a cave<br />
Sheltered deep down the monster. The sad queen<br />
Would scarcely leave me, though the priests shrunk back<br />
In terror. Last, torn from my endless kiss,<br />
Swooning they bore her upwards. All my robe<br />
Fell from my lifted arms, and left displayed<br />
The virgin treasure of my breasts; and then<br />
The white procession through the moonlight streamed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span><br />
Upwards, and soon their soft flutes sounded low<br />
Upon the high lawns, leaving me alone.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">There stood I in the moonlight, left alone<br />
Against the sea-worn rock. Hardly I knew,<br />
Seeing only the bright moon and summer sea,<br />
Which gently heaved and surged, and kissed the ledge<br />
With smooth warm tides, what fate was mine. I seemed,<br />
Soothed by the quiet, to be resting still<br />
Within my maiden chamber, and to watch<br />
The moonlight thro' my lattice. Then again<br />
Fear came, and then the pride of sacrifice<br />
Filled me, as on the high cliff lawns I heard<br />
The wailing cries, the chanted liturgies,<br />
And knew me bound forsaken to the rock,<br />
And saw the monster-haunted depths of sea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">So all night long upon the sandy shores<br />
I heard the hollow murmur of the wave,<br />
And all night long the hidden sea caves made<br />
A ghostly echo; and the sea birds mewed<br />
Around me; once I heard a mocking laugh,<br />
As of some scornful Nereid; once the waters<br />
Broke louder on the scarpèd reefs, and ebbed<br />
As if the monster coming; but again<br />
He came not, and the dead moon sank, and still<br />
Only upon the cliffs the wails, the chants,<br />
And I forsaken on my sea-worn rock,<br />
And lo, the monster-haunted depths of sea.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Till at the dead dark hour before the dawn,<br />
When sick men die, and scarcely fear itself<br />
Bore up my weary eyelids, a great surge<br />
Burst on the rock, and slowly, as it seemed,<br />
The sea sucked downward to its depths, laid bare<br />
The hidden reefs, and then before my eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
Oh, horrible! a huge and loathsome snake<br />
Lifted his dreadful crest and scaly side<br />
Above the wave, in bulk and length so large,<br />
Coil after hideous coil, that scarce the eye<br />
Could measure its full horror; the great jaws<br />
Dropped as with gore; the large and furious eyes<br />
Were fired with blood and lust. Nearer he came,<br />
And slowly, with a devilish glare, more near,<br />
Till his hot f&oelig;tor choked me, and his tongue,<br />
Forked horribly within his poisonous jaws,<br />
Played lightning-like around me. For awhile<br />
I swooned, and when I knew my life again,<br />
Death's bitterness was past.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">Then with a bound<br />
Leaped up the broad red sun above the sea,<br />
And lit the horrid fulgour of his scales,<br />
And struck upon the rock; and as I turned<br />
My head in the last agony of death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span><br />
I knew a brilliant sunbeam swiftly leaping<br />
Downward from crag to crag, and felt new hope<br />
Where all was hopeless. On the hills a shout<br />
Of joy, and on the rocks the ring of mail;<br />
And while the hungry serpent's gloating eyes<br />
Were fixed on me, a knight in casque of gold<br />
And blazing shield, who with his flashing blade<br />
Fell on the monster. Long the conflict raged,<br />
Till all the rocks were red with blood and slime,<br />
And yet my champion from those horrible jaws<br />
And dreadful coils was scatheless. Zeus his sire<br />
Protected, and the awful shield he bore<br />
Withered the monster's life and left him cold,<br />
Dragging his helpless length and grovelling crest:<br />
And o'er his glaring eyes the films of death<br />
Crept, and his writhing flank and hiss of hate<br />
The great deep swallowed down, and blood and spume<br />
Rose on the waves; and a strange wailing cry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span><br />
Resounded o'er the waters, and the sea<br />
Bellowed within its hollow-sounding caves.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then knew I, I was saved, and with me all<br />
The people. From my wrists he loosed the gyves,<br />
My hero; and within his godlike arms<br />
Bore me by slippery rock and difficult path,<br />
To where my mother prayed. There was no need<br />
To ask my love. Without a spoken word<br />
Love lit his fires within me. My young heart<br />
Went forth, Love calling, and I gave him all.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Dost thou then wonder that the memory<br />
Of this supreme brief moment lingers still,<br />
While all the happy uneventful years<br />
Of wedded life, and all the fair young growth<br />
Of offspring, and the tranquil later joys,<br />
Nay, even the fierce eventful fight which raged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span><br />
When we were wedded, fade and are deceased,<br />
Lost in the irrecoverable past?<br />
Nay, 'tis not strange. Always the memory<br />
Of overwhelming perils or great joys,<br />
Avoided or enjoyed, writes its own trace<br />
With such deep characters upon our lives,<br />
That all the rest are blotted. In this place,<br />
Where is not action, thought, or count of time,<br />
It is not weary as it were on earth,<br />
To dwell on these old memories. Time is born<br />
Of dawns and sunsets, days that wax and wane<br />
And stamp themselves upon the yielding face<br />
Of fleeting human life; but here there is<br />
Morning nor evening, act nor suffering,<br />
But only one unchanging Present holds<br />
Our being suspended. One blest day indeed,<br />
Or centuries ago or yesterday,<br />
There came among us one who was Divine,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span><br />
Not as our gods, joyous and breathing strength<br />
And careless life, but crowned with a new crown<br />
Of suffering, and a great light came with him,<br />
And with him he brought Time and a new sense<br />
Of dim, long-vanished years; and since he passed<br />
I seem to see new meaning in my fate,<br />
And all the deeds I tell of. Evermore<br />
The young life comes, bound to the cruel rocks<br />
Alone. Before it the unfathomed sea<br />
Smiles, filled with monstrous growths that wait to take<br />
Its innocence. Far off the voice and hand<br />
Of love kneel by in agony, and entreat<br />
The seeming careless gods. Still when the deep<br />
Is smoothest, lo, the deadly fangs and coils<br />
Lurk near, to smite with death. And o'er the crags<br />
Of duty, like a sudden sunbeam, springs<br />
Some golden soul half mortal, half divine,<br />
Heaven-sent, and breaks the chain; and evermore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span><br />
For sacrifice they die, through sacrifice<br />
They live, and are for others, and no grief<br />
Which smites the humblest but reverberates<br />
Thro' all the close-set files of life, and takes<br />
The princely soul that from its royal towers<br />
Looks down and sees the sorrow.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">Sir, farewell!<br />
If thou shouldst meet my children on the earth<br />
Or here, for maybe it is long ago<br />
Since I and they were living, say to them<br />
I only muse a little here, and wait<br />
The waking."</p>

<p class="v0 i13">And her lifted arms sank down<br />
Upon her knees, and as I passed I saw her<br />
Gazing with soft rapt eyes, and on her lips<br />
A smile as of a saint<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i22">And then I saw<br />
A manly hunter pace along the lea,<br />
His bow upon his shoulder, and his spear<br />
Poised idly in his hand: the face and form<br />
Of vigorous youth; but in the full brown eyes<br />
A timorous gaze as of a hunted hart,<br />
Brute-like, yet human still, even as the Faun<br />
Of old, the dumb brute passing into man,<br />
And dowered with double nature. As he came<br />
I seemed to question of his fate, and he<br />
Answered me thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i18">"'Twas one hot afternoon<br />
That I, a hunter, wearied with my day,<br />
Heard my hounds baying fainter on the hills,<br />
Led by the flying hart; and when the sound<br />
Faded and all was still, I turned to seek,<br />
O'ercome by heat and thirst, a little glade,<br />
Beloved of old, where, in the shadowy wood,<br />
The clear cold crystal of a mossy pool<br />
Lipped the soft emerald marge, and gave again<br />
The flower-starred lawn where ofttimes overspent<br />
I lay upon the grass and careless bathed<br />
My limbs in the sweet lymph.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">But as I neared<br />
The hollow, sudden through the leaves I saw<br />
A throng of wood-nymphs fair, sporting undraped<br />
Round one, a goddess. She with timid hand<br />
Loosened her zone, and glancing round let fall<br />
Her robe from neck and bosom, pure and bright,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span><br />
(For it was Dian's self I saw, none else)<br />
As when she frees her from a fleece of cloud<br />
And swims along the deep blue sea of heaven<br />
On sweet June nights. Silent awhile I stood,<br />
Rooted with awe, and fain had turned to fly,<br />
But feared by careless footstep to affright<br />
Those chaste cold eyes. Great awe and reverence<br />
Held me, and fear; then Love with passing wing<br />
Fanned me, and held my eyes, and checked my breath,<br />
Signing 'Beware!'</p>

<p class="v0 i18">So for a time I watched,<br />
Breathless as one a brooding nightmare holds,<br />
Who fleeth some great fear, yet fleeth not;<br />
Till the last flutter of lawn, and veil no more<br />
Obscured, and all the beauty of my dreams<br />
Assailed my sense. But ere I raised my eyes,<br />
As one who fain would look and see the sun,<br />
The first glance dazed my brain. Only I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span><br />
The perfect outline flow in tender curves,<br />
To break in doubled charms; only a haze<br />
Of creamy white, dimple, and deep divine:<br />
And then no more. For lo! a sudden chill,<br />
And such thick mist as shuts the hills at eve,<br />
Oppressed me gazing; and a heaven-sent shame,<br />
An awe, a fear, a reverence for the unknown,<br />
Froze all the springs of will and left me cold,<br />
And blinded all the longings of my eyes,<br />
Leaving such dim reflection still as mocks<br />
Him who has looked on a great light, and keeps<br />
On his closed eyes the image. Presently,<br />
My fainting soul, safe hidden for awhile<br />
Deep in Life's mystic shades, renewed herself,<br />
And straight, the innocent brute within the man<br />
Bore on me, and with half-averted eye<br />
I gazed upon the secret.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">As I looked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span><br />
A radiance, white as beamed the frosty moon<br />
On the mad boy and slew him, beamed on me;<br />
Made chill my pulses, checked my life and heat;<br />
Transformed me, withered all my soul, and left<br />
My being burnt out. For lo! the dreadful eyes<br />
Of Godhead met my gaze, and through the mask<br />
And thick disguise of sense, as through a wood,<br />
Pierced to my life. Then suddenly I knew<br />
An altered nature, touched by no desire<br />
For that which showed so lovely, but declined<br />
To lower levels. Nought of fear or awe,<br />
Nothing of love was mine. Wide-eyed I gazed,<br />
But saw no spiritual beam to blight<br />
My brain with too much beauty, no undraped<br />
And awful majesty; only a brute,<br />
Dumb charm, like that which draws the brute to it,<br />
Unknowing it is drawn. So gradually<br />
I knew a dull content o'ercloud my sense,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span><br />
And unabashed I gazed, like that dumb bird<br />
Which thinks no thought and speaks no word, yet fronts<br />
The sun that blinded Homer&mdash;all my fear<br />
Sunk with my shame, in a base happiness.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">But as I gazed, and careless turned and passed<br />
Through the thick wood, forgetting what had been,<br />
And thinking thoughts no longer, swift there came<br />
A mortal terror: voices that I knew,<br />
My own hounds' bayings that I loved before,<br />
As with them often o'er the purple hills<br />
I chased the flying hart from slope to slope,<br />
Before the slow sun climbed the Eastern peaks,<br />
Until the swift sun smote the Western plain;<br />
Whom often I had cheered by voice and glance,<br />
Whom often I had checked with hand and thong<br />
Grim followers, like the passions, firing me,<br />
True servants, like the strong nerves, urging me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span><br />
On many a fruitless chase, to find and take<br />
Some too swift-fleeting beauty; faithful feet<br />
And tongues, obedient always: these I knew,<br />
Clothed with a new-born force and vaster grown,<br />
And stronger than their master; and I thought,<br />
What if they tare me with their jaws, nor knew<br />
That once I ruled them,&mdash;brute pursuing brute,<br />
And I the quarry? Then I turned and fled,&mdash;<br />
If it was I indeed that feared and fled&mdash;<br />
Down the long glades, and through the tangled brakes,<br />
Where scarce the sunlight pierced; fled on and on,<br />
And panted, self-pursued. But evermore<br />
The dissonant music which I knew so sweet,<br />
When by the windy hills, the echoing vales,<br />
And whispering pines it rang, now far, now near,<br />
As from my rushing steed I leant and cheered<br />
With voice and horn the chase&mdash;this brought to me<br />
Fear of I knew not what, which bade me fly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span><br />
Fly always, fly; but when my heart stood still,<br />
And all my limbs were stiffened as I fled,<br />
Just as the white moon ghost-like climbed the sky,<br />
Nearer they came and nearer, baying loud,<br />
With bloodshot eyes and red jaws dripping foam;<br />
And when I strove to check their savagery,<br />
Speaking with words; no voice articulate came,<br />
Only a dumb, low bleat. Then all the throng<br />
Leapt swift on me, and tare me as I lay,<br />
And left me man again.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">Wherefore I walk<br />
Along these dim fields peopled with the ghosts<br />
Of heroes who have left the ways of earth<br />
For this faint ghost of them. Sometimes I think,<br />
Pondering on what has been, that all my days<br />
Were shadows, all my life an allegory;<br />
And, though I know sometimes some fainter gleam<br />
Of the old beauty move me, and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span><br />
Some beat of the old pulses; that my fate,<br />
For ever hurrying on in hot pursuit,<br />
To fall at length self-slain, was but a tale<br />
Writ large by Zeus upon a mortal life,<br />
Writ large, and yet a riddle. For sometimes<br />
I read its meaning thus: Life is a chase,<br />
And Man the hunter, always following on,<br />
With hounds of rushing thought or fiery sense,<br />
Some hidden truth or beauty, fleeting still<br />
For ever through the thick-leaved coverts deep<br />
And wind-worn wolds of time. And if he turn<br />
A moment from the hot pursuit to seize<br />
Some chance-brought sweetness, other than the search<br />
To which his soul is set,&mdash;some dalliance,<br />
Some outward shape of Art, some lower love,<br />
Some charm of wealth and sleek content and home,&mdash;<br />
Then, if he check an instant, the swift chase<br />
Of fierce untempered energies which pursue,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span><br />
With jaws unsated and a thirst for act,<br />
Bears down on him with clanging shock, and whelms<br />
His prize and him in ruin.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">And sometimes<br />
I seem to myself a thinker, who at last,<br />
Amid the chase and capture of low ends,<br />
Pausing by some cold well of hidden thought<br />
Comes on some perfect truth, and looks and looks<br />
Till the fair vision blinds him. And the sum<br />
Of all his lower self pursuing him,<br />
The strong brute forces, the unchecked desires,<br />
Finding him bound and speechless, deem him now<br />
No more their master, but some soulless thing;<br />
And leap on him, and seize him, and possess<br />
His life, till through death's gate he pass to life,<br />
And, his own ghost, revives. But looks no more<br />
Upon the truth unveiled, save through a cloud<br />
Of creed and faith and longing, which shall change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span><br />
One day to perfect knowledge.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">But whoe'er<br />
Shall read the riddle of my life, I walk<br />
In this dim land amid dim ghosts of kings,<br />
As one day thou shalt; meantime, fare thou well."</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then passed he; and I marked him slowly go<br />
Along the winding ways of that weird land,<br />
And vanish in a wood.</p>

<p class="v4 i22">And next I knew<br />
A woman perfect as a young man's dream,<br />
And breathing as it seemed the old sweet air<br />
Of the fair days of old, when man was young<br />
And life an Epic. Round the lips a smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span><br />
Subtle and deep and sweet as hers who looks<br />
From the old painter's canvas, and derides<br />
Life and the riddle of things, the aimless strife,<br />
The folly of Love, as who has proved it all,<br />
Enjoyed and suffered. In the lovely eyes<br />
A weary look, no other than the gaze<br />
Which ofttimes as the rapid chariot whirls,<br />
And ofttimes by the glaring midnight streets,<br />
Gleams out and chills our thought. And yet not guilt<br />
Nor sorrow was it; only weariness,<br />
No more, and still most lovely. As I named<br />
Her name in haste, she looked with half surprise,<br />
And thus she seemed to speak:</p>

<p class="v0 i30">"What? Dost thou know<br />
Thou too, the fatal glances which beguiled<br />
Those strong rude chiefs of old? Has not the gloom<br />
Of this dim land withdrawn from out mine eyes<br />
The glamour which once filled them? Does my cheek<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span><br />
Retain the round of youth and still defy<br />
The wear of immemorial centuries?<br />
And this low voice, long silent, keeps it still<br />
The music of old time? Aye, in thine eyes<br />
I read it, and within thine eyes I see<br />
Thou knowest me, and the story of my life<br />
Sung by the blind old bard when I was dead,<br />
And all my lovers dust. I know thee not,<br />
Thee nor thy gods, yet would I soothly swear<br />
I was not all to blame for what has been,<br />
The long fight, the swift death, the woes, the tears<br />
The brave lives spent, the humble homes uptorn<br />
To gain one poor fair face. It was not I<br />
That curved these lips into this subtle smile,<br />
Or gave these eyes their fire, nor yet made round<br />
This supple frame. It was not I, but Love,<br />
Love mirroring himself in all things fair,<br />
Love that projects himself upon a life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span><br />
And dotes on his own image.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">Ah! the days,<br />
The weary years of Love and feasts and gold,<br />
The hurried flights, the din of clattering hoofs<br />
At midnight, when the heroes dared for me,<br />
And bore me o'er the hills; the swift pursuits<br />
Baffled and lost; or when from isle to isle<br />
The high-oared galley spread its wings and rose<br />
Over the swelling surges, and I saw,<br />
Time after time, the scarce familiar town,<br />
The sharp-cut hills, the well-loved palaces,<br />
The gleaming temples fade, and all for me,<br />
Me the dead prize, the shell, the soulless ghost,<br />
The husk of a true woman; the fond words<br />
Wasted on careless ears, that seemed to hear,<br />
Of love to me unloving; the rich feasts,<br />
The silken dalliance and soft luxury,<br />
The fair observance and high reverence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span><br />
For me who cared not, to whatever land<br />
My kingly lover snatched me. I have known<br />
How small a fence Love sets between the king<br />
And the strong hind, who breeds his brood, and dies<br />
Upon the field he tills. I have exchanged<br />
People for people, crown for glittering crown,<br />
Through every change a queen, and held my state<br />
Hateful, and sickened in my soul to lie<br />
Stretched on soft cushions to the lutes' low sound,<br />
While on the wasted fields the clang of arms<br />
Rang, and the foemen perished, and swift death,<br />
Hunger, and plague, and every phase of woe<br />
Vexed all the land for me. I have heard the curse<br />
Unspoken, when the wife widowed for me<br />
Clasped to her heart her orphans starved for me;<br />
As I swept proudly by. I have prayed the gods,<br />
Hating my own fair face which wrought such woe,<br />
Some plague divine might light on it and leave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span><br />
My curse a ruin. Yet I think indeed<br />
They had not cursed but pitied, those true wives<br />
Who mourned their humble lords, and straining felt<br />
The innocent thrill which swells the mother's heart<br />
Who clasps her growing boy; had they but known<br />
The lifeless life, the pain of hypocrite smiles,<br />
The dead load of caresses simulated,<br />
When Love stands shuddering by to see his fires<br />
Lit for the shrine of gold. What if they felt<br />
The weariness of loveless love which grew<br />
And through the jealous palace portals seized<br />
The caged unloving woman, sick of toys,<br />
Sick of her gilded chains, her ease, herself,<br />
Till for sheer weariness she flew to meet<br />
Some new unloved seducer? What if they knew<br />
No childish loving hands, or worse than all,<br />
Had borne them sullen to a sire unloved,<br />
And left them without pain? I might have been,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span><br />
I too, a loving mother and chaste wife,<br />
Had Fate so willed.</p>

<p class="v0 i20">For I remember well<br />
How one day straying from my father's halls<br />
Seeking anemones and violets,<br />
A girl in Spring-time, when the heart makes Spring<br />
Within the budding bosom, that I came<br />
Of a sudden through a wood upon a bay,<br />
A little sunny land-locked bay, whose banks<br />
Sloped gently downward to the yellow sand,<br />
Where the blue wave creamed soft with fairy foam,<br />
And oft the Nereids sported. As I strayed<br />
Singing, with fresh-pulled violets in my hair<br />
And bosom, and my hands were full of flowers,<br />
I came upon a little milk-white lamb,<br />
And took it in my arms and fondled it,<br />
And wreathed its neck with flowers, and sang to it<br />
And kissed it, and the Spring was in my life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span><br />
And I was glad.</p>

<p class="v0 i16">And when I raised my eyes<br />
Behold, a youthful shepherd with his crook<br />
Stood by me and regarded as I lay,<br />
Tall, fair, with clustering curls, and front that wore<br />
A budding manhood. As I looked a fear<br />
Came o'er me, lest he were some youthful god<br />
Disguised in shape of man, so fair he was;<br />
But when he spoke, the kindly face was full<br />
Of manhood, and the large eyes full of fire<br />
Drew me without a word, and all the flowers<br />
Fell from me, and the little milk-white lamb<br />
Strayed through the brake, and took with it the white<br />
Fair years of childhood. Time fulfilled my being<br />
With passion like a cup, and with one kiss<br />
Left me a woman.</p>

<p class="v0 i17">Ah! the lovely days,<br />
When on the warm bank crowned with flowers we sate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span><br />
And thought no harm, and his thin reed pipe made<br />
Low music, and no witness of our love<br />
Intruded, but the tinkle of the flock<br />
Came from the hill, and 'neath the odorous shade<br />
We dreamed away the day, and watched the waves<br />
Steal shoreward, and beyond the sylvan capes<br />
The innumerable laughter of the sea!</p>

<p class="v1 i0">Ah youth and love! So passed the happy days<br />
Till twilight, and I stole as in a dream<br />
Homeward, and lived as in a happy dream,<br />
And when they spoke answered as in a dream,<br />
And through the darkness saw, as in a glass,<br />
The happy, happy day, and thrilled and glowed<br />
And kept my love in sleep, and longed for dawn<br />
And scarcely stayed for hunger, and with morn<br />
Stole eager to the little wood, and fed<br />
My life with kisses. Ah! the joyous days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span><br />
Of innocence, when Love was Queen in heaven,<br />
And nature unreproved! Break they then still,<br />
Those azure circles, on a golden shore?<br />
Smiles there no glade upon the older earth<br />
Where spite of all, gray wisdom, and new gods,<br />
Young lovers dream within each other's arms<br />
Silent, by shadowy grove, or sunlit sea?</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah days too fair to last! There came a night<br />
When I lay longing for my love, and knew<br />
Sudden the clang of hoofs, the broken doors.<br />
The clash of swords, the shouts, the groans, the stain<br />
Of red upon the marble, the fixed gaze<br />
Of dead and dying eyes,&mdash;that was the time<br />
When first I looked on death,&mdash;and when I woke<br />
From my deep swoon, I felt the night air cool<br />
Upon my brow, and the cold stars look down,<br />
As swift we galloped o'er the darkling plain;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span><br />
And saw the chill sea glimpses slowly wake,<br />
With arms unknown around me. When the dawn<br />
Broke swift, we panted on the pathless steeps,<br />
And so by plain and mountain till we came<br />
To Athens, where they kept me till I grew<br />
Fairer with every year, and many wooed,<br />
Heroes and chieftains, but I loved not one.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And then the avengers came and snatched me back<br />
To Sparta. All the dark high-crested chiefs<br />
Of Argos wooed me, striving king with king<br />
For one fair foolish face, nor knew I kept<br />
No heart to give them. Yet since I was grown<br />
Weary of honeyed words and suit of love,<br />
I wedded a brave chief, dauntless and true.<br />
But what cared I? I could not prize at all<br />
His honest service. I had grown so tired<br />
Of loving and of love, that when they brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span><br />
News that the fairest shepherd on the hills,<br />
Having done himself to death for his lost love,<br />
Lay, like a lovely statue, cold and white<br />
Upon the golden sand, I hardly knew<br />
More than a passing pang. Love, like a flower,<br />
Love, springing up too tall in a young breast,<br />
The growth of morning, Life's too scorching sun<br />
Had withered long ere noon. Love, like a flame<br />
On his own altar offering up my heart,<br />
Had burnt my being to ashes.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">Was it love<br />
That drew me then to Paris? He was fair,<br />
I grant you, fairer than a summer morn,<br />
Fair with a woman's fairness, yet in arms<br />
A hero, but he never had my heart,<br />
Not love for him allured me, but the thirst<br />
For freedom, if in more than thought I erred,<br />
And was not rapt but willing. For my child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span><br />
Born to an unloved father, loved me not,<br />
The fresh sea called, the galleys plunged, and I<br />
Fled willing from my prison and the pain<br />
Of undesired caresses, and the wind<br />
Was fair, and on the third day as we sailed,<br />
My heart was glad within me when I saw<br />
The towers of Ilium rise beyond the wave.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah, the long years, the melancholy years,<br />
The miserable melancholy years!<br />
For soon the new grew old, and then I grew<br />
Weary of him, of all, of pomp and state<br />
And novel splendour. Yet at times I knew<br />
Some thrill of pride within me as I saw<br />
From those high walls, a prisoner and a foe,<br />
The swift ships flock at anchor in the bay,<br />
The hasty landing and the flash of arms,<br />
The lines of royal tents upon the plain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span><br />
The close-shut gates, the chivalry within<br />
Issuing in all its pride to meet the shock<br />
Of the bold chiefs without; so year by year<br />
The haughty challenge from the warring hosts<br />
Rang forth, and I with a divided heart<br />
Saw victory incline, now here, now there,<br />
And helpless marked the Argive chiefs I knew,<br />
The spouse I left, the princely loves of old,<br />
Now with each other strive, and now with Troy:<br />
The brave pomp of the morn, the fair strong limbs,<br />
The glittering panoply, the bold young hearts,<br />
Athirst for fame of war, and with the night<br />
The broken spear, the shattered helm, the plume<br />
Dyed red with blood, the ghastly dying face,<br />
And nerveless limbs laid lifeless. And I knew<br />
The stainless Hector whom I could have loved,<br />
But that a happy love made blind his eyes<br />
To all my baleful beauty; fallen and dragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span><br />
His noble, manly head upon the sand<br />
By young Achilles' chariot; him in turn<br />
Fallen and slain; my fair false Paris slain;<br />
Plague, famine, battle, raging now within,<br />
And now without, for many a weary year,<br />
Summer and winter, till I loathed to live,<br />
Who was indeed, as well they said, the Hell<br />
Of men, and fleets, and cities. As I stood<br />
Upon the walls, ofttimes a longing came,<br />
Looking on rage, and fight, and blood, and death,<br />
To end it all, and dash me down and die;<br />
But no god helped me. Nay, one day I mind<br />
I would entreat them. 'Pray you, lords, be men.<br />
What fatal charm is this which Até gives<br />
To one poor foolish face? Be strong, and turn<br />
In peace, forget this glamour, get you home<br />
With all your fleets and armies, to the land<br />
I love no longer, where your faithful wives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span><br />
Pine widowed of their lords, and your young boys<br />
Grow wild to manhood. I have nought to give,<br />
No heart, nor prize of love for any man,<br />
Nor recompense. I am the ghost alone<br />
Of the fair girl ye knew; she still abides,<br />
If she still lives and is not wholly dead,<br />
Stretched on a flowery bank upon the sea<br />
In fair heroic Argos. Leave this form<br />
That is no other than the outward shell<br />
Of a once loving woman.'</p>

<p class="v0 i25">As I spake,<br />
My pity fired my eyes and flushed my cheek<br />
With some soft charm; and as I spread my hands,<br />
The purple, glancing down a little, left<br />
The marble of my breasts and one pink bud<br />
Upon the gleaming snows. And as I looked<br />
With a mixed pride and terror, I beheld<br />
The brute rise up within them, and my words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span><br />
Fall barren on them. So I sat apart,<br />
Nor ever more looked forth, while every day<br />
Brought its own woe.</p>

<p class="v0 i21">The melancholy years,<br />
The miserable melancholy years,<br />
Crept onward till the midnight terror came,<br />
And by the glare of burning streets I saw<br />
Palace and temple reel in ruin and fall,<br />
And the long-baffled legions, bursting in<br />
By gate and bastion, blunted sword and spear<br />
With unresisted slaughter. From my tower<br />
I saw the good old king; his kindly eyes<br />
In agony, and all his reverend hairs<br />
Dabbled with blood, as the fierce foeman thrust<br />
And stabbed him as he lay; the youths, the girls,<br />
Whom day by day I knew, their silken ease<br />
And royal luxury changed for blood and tears,<br />
Haled forth to death or worse. Then a great hate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span><br />
Of life and fate seized on me, and I rose<br />
And rushed among them, crying, 'See, 'tis I,<br />
I who have brought this evil! Kill me! kill<br />
The fury that is I, yet is not I!<br />
And let my soul go outward through the wound<br />
Made clean by blood to Hades! Let me die,<br />
Not these who did no wrong!' But not a hand<br />
Was raised, and all shrank backward as afraid,<br />
As from a goddess. Then I swooned and fell<br />
And knew no more, and when I woke I felt<br />
My husband's arms around me, and the wind<br />
Blew fair for Greece, and the beaked galley plunged;<br />
And where the towers of Ilium rose of old,<br />
A pall of smoke above a glare of fire.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">What then in the near future?</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Ten long years<br />
Bring youth and love to that deep summer-tide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span><br />
When the full noisy current of our lives<br />
Creeps dumb through wealth of flowers. I think I knew<br />
Somewhat of peace at last, with my good Lord<br />
Who loved too much, to palter with the past,<br />
Flushed with the present. Young Hermione<br />
Had grown from child to woman. She was wed;<br />
And was not I her mother? At the pomp<br />
Of solemn nuptials and requited love,<br />
I prayed she might be happy, happier far<br />
Than ever I was; so in tranquil ease<br />
I lived a queen long time, and because wealth<br />
And high observance can make sweet our days<br />
When youth's swift joy is past, I did requite<br />
With what I might, not love, the kindly care<br />
Of him I loved not; pomps and robes of price<br />
And chariots held me. But when Fate cut short<br />
His life and love, his sons who were not mine<br />
Reigned in his stead, and hated me and mine:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span><br />
And knowing I was friendless, I sailed forth<br />
Once more across the sea, seeking for rest<br />
And shelter. Still I knew that in my eyes<br />
Love dwelt, and all the baleful charm of old<br />
Burned as of yore, scarce dimmed as yet by time:<br />
I saw it in the mirror of the sea,<br />
I saw it in the youthful seamen's eyes,<br />
And was half proud again I had such power<br />
Who now kept nothing else. So one calm eve,<br />
Behold, a sweet fair isle blushed like a rose<br />
Upon the summer sea: there my swift ship<br />
Cast anchor, and they told me it was Rhodes.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">There, in a little wood above the sea,<br />
Like that dear wood of yore, I wandered forth<br />
Forlorn, and all my seamen were apart,<br />
And I, alone; when at the close of day<br />
I knew myself surrounded by strange churls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span><br />
With angry eyes, and one who ordered them,<br />
A woman, whom I knew not, but who walked<br />
In mien and garb a queen. She, with the fire<br />
Of hate within her eyes, 'Quick, bind her, men!<br />
I know her; bind her fast!' Then to the trunk<br />
Of a tall plane they bound me with rude cords<br />
That cut my arms. And meantime, far below,<br />
The sun was gilding fair with dying rays<br />
Isle after isle and purple wastes of sea.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And then she signed to them, and all withdrew<br />
Among the woods and left us, face to face,<br />
Two women. Ere I spoke, 'I know,' she said,<br />
'I know that evil fairness. This it was,<br />
Or ever he had come across my life,<br />
That made him cold to me, who had my love<br />
And left me half a heart. If all my life<br />
Of wedlock was but half a life, what fiend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span><br />
Came 'twixt my love and me, but that fair face?<br />
What left his children orphans, but that face?<br />
And me a widow? Fiend! I have thee now;<br />
Thou hast not long to live. I will requite<br />
Thy murders; yet, oh fiend! that art so fair,<br />
Were it not haply better to deface<br />
Thy fatal loveliness, and leave thee bare<br />
Of all thy baleful power? And yet I doubt,<br />
And looking on thy face I doubt the more,<br />
Lest all thy dower of fairness be the gift<br />
Of Aphrodité, and I fear to fight<br />
Against the immortal Gods.'</p>

<p class="v1 i28">Even with the word,<br />
And she relenting, all the riddle of life<br />
Flashed through me, and the inextricable coil<br />
Of Being, and the immeasurable depths<br />
And irony of Fate, burst on my thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span><br />
And left me smiling in the eyes of death,<br />
With this deep smile thou seëst. Then with a shriek<br />
The woman leapt on me, and with blind rage<br />
Strangled my life. And when she had done the deed<br />
She swooned, and those her followers hasting back<br />
Fell prone upon their knees before the corpse<br />
As to a goddess. Then one went and brought<br />
A sculptor, and within a jewelled shrine<br />
They set me in white marble, bound to a tree<br />
Of marble. And they came and knelt to me,<br />
Young men and maidens, through the secular years,<br />
While the old gods bore sway, but I was here,<br />
And now they kneel no longer, for the world<br />
Has gone from beauty.</p>

<p class="v0 i22">But I think, indeed,<br />
They well might worship still, for never yet<br />
Was any thought or thing of beauty born<br />
Except with suffering. That poor wretch who thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span><br />
I injured her, stealing the foolish heart<br />
Which she prized but I could not, what knew she<br />
Of that I suffered? She had loved her love,<br />
Though unrequited, and had borne to him<br />
Children who loved her. What if she had been<br />
Loved yet unloving: all the fire of love<br />
Burnt out before love's time in one brief blaze<br />
Of passion. Ah, poor fool! I pity her,<br />
Being blest and yet unthankful, and forgive,<br />
Now that she is a ghost as I, the hand<br />
Which loosed my load of life. For scarce indeed<br />
Could any god who cares for mortal men<br />
Have ever kept me happy. I had tired<br />
Of simple loving, doubtless, as I tired<br />
Of splendour and being loved. There be some souls<br />
For which love is enough, content to bear<br />
From youth to age, from chesnut locks to gray,<br />
The load of common, uneventful life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span><br />
And penury. But I was not of these;<br />
I know not now, if it were best indeed<br />
That I had reared my simple shepherd brood,<br />
And lived and died unknown in some poor hut<br />
Among the Argive hills; or lived a queen<br />
As I did, knowing every day that dawned<br />
Some high emprise and glorious, and in death<br />
To fill the world with song. Not the same meed<br />
The gods mete out for all, or She, the dread<br />
Necessity, who rules both gods and men,<br />
Some to dishonour, some to honour moulds,<br />
To happiness some, some to unhappiness.<br />
We are what Zeus has made us, discords playing<br />
In the great music, but the harmony<br />
Is sweeter for them, and the great spheres ring<br />
In one accordant hymn.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">But thou, if e'er<br />
There come a daughter of thy love, oh pray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span><br />
To all thy gods, lest haply they should mar<br />
Her life with too great beauty!"</p>

<p class="v0 i33">So she ceased.<br />
The fairest woman that the poet's dream<br />
Or artist hand has fashioned. All the gloom<br />
Seemed lightened round her, and I heard the sound<br />
Of her melodious voice when all was still,<br />
And the dim twilight took her.</p>

<p class="v4 i31">Next there came<br />
Two who together walked: one with a lyre<br />
Of gold, which gave no sound; the other hung<br />
Upon his breast, and closely clung to him,<br />
Spent in a tender longing. As they came,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span><br />
I heard her gentle voice recounting o'er<br />
Some ancient tale, and these the words she said:</p>

<p class="v1 i2">"Dear voice and lyre now silent, which I heard<br />
Across yon sullen river, bringing to me<br />
All my old life, and he, the ferryman,<br />
Heard and obeyed, and the grim monster heard<br />
And fawned on you. Joyous thou cam'st and free<br />
Like a white sunbeam from the dear bright earth,<br />
Where suns shone clear, and moons beamed bright, and streams<br />
Laughed with a rippling music,&mdash;nor as here<br />
The dumb stream stole, the veiled sky slept, the fields<br />
Were lost in twilight. Like a morning breeze,<br />
Which blows in summer from the gates of dawn<br />
Across the fields of spice, and wakes to life<br />
Their slumbering perfume, through this silent land<br />
Of whispering voices and of half-closed eyes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span><br />
Where scarce a footstep sounds, nor any strain<br />
Of earthly song, thou cam'st; and suddenly<br />
The pale cheeks flushed a little, the murmured words<br />
Rose to a faint, thin treble; the throng of ghosts<br />
Pacing along the sunless ways and still,<br />
Felt a new life. Thou camest, dear, and straight<br />
The dull cold river broke in sparkling foam,<br />
The pale and scentless flowers grew perfumed; last<br />
To the dim chamber, where with the sad queen<br />
I sat in gloom, and silently inwove<br />
Dead wreaths of amaranths; thy music came<br />
Laden with life, and I, who seemed to know<br />
Not life's voice only, but my own, rose up,<br />
Along the hollow pathways following<br />
The sound which brought back earth and life and love,<br />
And memory and longing. Yet I went<br />
With half-reluctant footsteps, as of one<br />
Whom passion draws, or some high fantasy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span><br />
Despite himself, because some subtle spell,<br />
Part born of dread to cross that sullen stream<br />
And its grim guardians, part of secret shame<br />
Of the young airs and freshness of the earth,<br />
Being that I was, enchained me.</p>

<p class="v0 i32">Then at last,<br />
From voice and lyre so high a strain arose<br />
As trembled on the utter verge of being,<br />
And thrilling, poured out life. Thus closelier drawn<br />
I walked with thee, shut in by halcyon sound<br />
And soft environments of harmony,<br />
Beyond the ghostly gates, beyond the dim<br />
Calm fields, where the beetle hummed and the pale owl<br />
Stole noiseless from the copse, and the white blooms<br />
Stretched thin for lack of sun: so fair a light<br />
Born out of consonant sound environed me.<br />
Nor looked I backward, as we seemed to move<br />
To some high goal of thought and life and love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span><br />
Like twin birds flying fast with equal wing<br />
Out of the night, to meet the coming sun<br />
Above a sea. But on thy dear fair eyes,<br />
The eyes that well I knew on the old earth,<br />
I looked not, for with still averted gaze<br />
Thou leddest, and I followed; for, indeed,<br />
While that high strain was sounding, I was rapt<br />
In faith and a high courage, driving out<br />
All doubt and discontent and womanish fear,<br />
Nay, even my love itself. But when awhile<br />
It sank a little, or seemed to sink and fall<br />
To lower levels, seeing that use makes blunt<br />
The too accustomed ear, straightway, desire<br />
To look once more on thy recovered eyes<br />
Seized me, and oft I called with piteous voice,<br />
Beseeching thee to turn. But thou long time<br />
Wert even as one unmindful, with grave sign<br />
And waving hand, denying. Finally,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span><br />
When now we neared the stream, on whose far shore<br />
Lay life, great terror took me, and I shrieked<br />
Thy name, as in despair. Then thou, as one<br />
Who knows him set in some great jeopardy,<br />
A swift death fronting him on either hand,<br />
Didst slowly turning gaze; and lo! I saw<br />
Thine eyes grown awful, life that looked on death,<br />
Clear purity on dark and cankered sin,<br />
The immortal on corruption,&mdash;not the eyes<br />
That erst I knew in life, but dreadfuller,<br />
And stranger. As I looked, I seemed to swoon,<br />
Some blind force whirled me back, and when I woke<br />
I saw thee vanish in the middle stream,<br />
A speck on the dull waters, taking with thee<br />
My life, and leaving Love with me. But I<br />
Not for myself bewail, but all for thee,<br />
Who, but for me, wert now among the stars<br />
With thy great Lord; I sitting at thy feet:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span><br />
But now the fierce and unrestrainèd rout<br />
Of passions woman-natured, finding thee<br />
Scornful of love within thy lonely cell,<br />
With blind rage falling on thee, tore thy limbs,<br />
And left them to the Muses' sepulture,<br />
While thy soul dwells in Hades. But I wail<br />
My weakness always, who for Love destroyed<br />
The life that was my Love. I prithee, dear,<br />
Forgive me if thou canst, who hast lost heaven<br />
To save a loving woman."</p>

<p class="v0 i25">He with voice<br />
Sweeter than any mortal melody,<br />
And plaintive as the music that is made<br />
By the Æolian strings, or the sad bird<br />
That sings of summer nights:</p>

<p class="v0 i29">"Eurydice,<br />
Dear love, be comforted; not once alone<br />
That which thou mournest is, but day by day<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span><br />
Some lonely soul, which walks apart and feeds<br />
On high hill pastures, far from herds of men,<br />
Comes to the low fat fields, and sunny vales<br />
Joyous with fruits and flowers, and the white arms<br />
Of laughing love; and there awhile he stays<br />
Content, forgetting all the joys he knew,<br />
When first the morning broke upon the hills,<br />
And the keen air breathed from the Eastern gates<br />
Like a pure draught of wine; forgetting all<br />
The strains which float, as from a nearer heaven,<br />
To him who treads at dawn the untrodden snows,<br />
While all the warm world sleeps;&mdash;forgetting these<br />
And all things that have been. And if he gain<br />
To raise to his own heights the simpler souls<br />
That dwell upon the plains, the untutored thought,<br />
The museless lives, the unawakened brain<br />
That yet might soar, then is he blest indeed.<br />
But if he fail, then, leaving love behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span><br />
The wider love of the race, the closer love<br />
Of some congenial soul, he turns again<br />
To the old difficult steeps, and there alone<br />
Pines, till the widowed passions of his heart<br />
Tear him and rend his soul, and drive him down<br />
To the low plains he left. And there he dwells,<br />
Missing the heavens, dear, and the white peaks,<br />
And the light air of old; but in their stead<br />
Finding the soft sweet sun of the vale, the clouds<br />
Which veil the skies indeed, but give the rains<br />
That feed the streams of life and make earth green,<br />
And bring at last the harvest. So I walk<br />
In this dim land content with thee, O Love,<br />
Untouched by any yearning of regret<br />
For those old days; nor that the lyre which made<br />
Erewhile such potent music now is dumb;<br />
Nor that the voice that once could move the earth<br />
(Zeus speaking through it), speaks in household words<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span><br />
Of homely love: Love is enough for me<br />
With thee, O dearest; and perchance at last,<br />
Zeus willing, this dumb lyre and whispered voice<br />
Shall wake, by Love inspired, to such clear note<br />
As soars above the stars, and swelling, lifts<br />
Our souls to highest heaven."</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Then he stooped,<br />
And, folded in one long embrace, they went<br />
And faded. And I cried, "Oh, strong God, Love,<br />
Mightier than Death and Hell!"</p>

<p class="v2 i31">And then I chanced<br />
On a fair woman, whose sad eyes were full<br />
Of a fixed self-reproach, like his who knows<br />
Himself the fountain of his grief, and pines<br />
In self-inflicted sorrow. As I spake<br />
Enquiring of her grief, she answered thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>:</p>

<p class="v1 i2">"Stranger, thou seest of all the shades below<br />
The most unhappy. Others sought their love<br />
In death, and found it, dying; but for me<br />
The death that took me, took from me my love,<br />
And left me comfortless. No load I bear<br />
Like those dark wicked women, who have slain<br />
Their Lords for lust or anger, whom the dread<br />
Propitious Ones within the pit below<br />
Punish and purge of sin; only unfaith,<br />
If haply want of faith be not a crime<br />
Blacker than murder, when we fail to trust<br />
One worthy of all faith, and folly bring<br />
No harder recompense than comes of scorn<br />
And loathing of itself.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">Ah, fool, fool, fool,<br />
Who didst mistrust thy love, who was the best,<br />
And truest, manliest soul with whom the gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span><br />
Have ever blest the earth; so brave, so strong,<br />
Fired with such burning hate of powerful ill,<br />
So loving of the race, so swift to raise<br />
The fearless arm and mighty club, and smite<br />
All monstrous growths with ruin&mdash;Zeus himself<br />
Showed scarce more mighty&mdash;and yet was the while<br />
A very man, not cast in mould too fine<br />
For human love, but ofttimes snared and caught<br />
By womanish wiles, fast held within the net<br />
His passions wove. Oh, it was grand to hear<br />
Of how he went, the champion of his race,<br />
Mighty in war, mighty in love, now bent<br />
To more than human tasks, now lapt in ease,<br />
Now suffering, now enjoying. Strong, vast soul,<br />
Tuned to heroic deeds, and set on high<br />
Above the range of common petty sins&mdash;<br />
Too high to mate with an unequal soul,<br />
Too full of striving for contented days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah me, how well I do recall the cause<br />
Of all our ills! I was a happy bride<br />
When that dark Até which pursues the steps<br />
Of heroes&mdash;innocent blood-guiltiness&mdash;<br />
Drove us to exile, and I joyed to be<br />
His own, and share his pain. To a swift stream<br />
Fleeing we came, where a rough ferryman<br />
Waited, more brute than man. My hero plunged<br />
In those fierce depths and battled with their flow,<br />
And with great labour gained the strand, and bade<br />
The monster row me to him. But with lust<br />
And brutal cunning in his eyes, the thing<br />
Seized me and turned to fly with me, when swift<br />
An arrow hissed from the unerring bow,<br />
Pierced him, and loosed his grasp. Then as his eyes<br />
Grew glazed in death there came in them a gleam<br />
Of what I know was hate, and he said, 'Take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span><br />
This white robe. It is costly. See, my blood<br />
Has stained it but a little. I did wrong:<br />
I know it, and repent me. If there come<br />
A time when he grows cold&mdash;for all the race<br />
Of heroes wander, nor can any love<br />
Fix theirs for long&mdash;take it and wrap him in it,<br />
And he shall love again.' Then, from the strange<br />
Deep look within his eyes I shrank in fear,<br />
And left him half in pity, and I went<br />
To meet my Lord, who rose from that fierce stream<br />
Fair as a god.</p>

<p class="v0 i15">Ah me, the weary days<br />
We women live, spending our anxious souls,<br />
Consumed with jealous fancies, hungering still<br />
For the belovèd voice and ear and eye,<br />
And hungering all in vain! For life is more<br />
To youthful manhood than to sit at home<br />
Before the hearth to watch the children's ways<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span><br />
And lead the life of petty household care<br />
Which doth content us women. Day by day<br />
I pined in Trachis for my love, while he,<br />
Now in some warlike exploit busied, now<br />
Fighting some monster, now at some fair court,<br />
Resting awhile till some new enterprise<br />
Called him, returned not. News of treacheries<br />
Avenged, friends succoured, dreadful monsters slain,<br />
Came from him: always triumph, always fame,<br />
And honour, and success, and reverence,<br />
And sometimes, words of love for me who pined<br />
For more than words, and would have gone to him<br />
But that the toils of such high errantry<br />
Asked more than woman's strength.</p>

<p class="v0 i34">So the slow years<br />
Vexed me alone in Trachis, set forlorn<br />
In solitude, nor hearing at the gate<br />
The frank and cheering voice, nor on the stair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span><br />
The heavy tread, nor feeling the strong arm<br />
Around me in the darkling night, when all<br />
My being ran slow. Last, subtle whispers came<br />
Of womanish wiles which kept my Lord from me,<br />
And one who, young and fair, a fresh-blown life<br />
And virgin, younger, fairer far than I<br />
When first he loved me, held him in the toils<br />
Of scarce dissembled love. Not easily<br />
Might I believe this evil, but at last<br />
The oft-repeated malice finding me<br />
Forlorn, and sitting imp-like at my ear,<br />
Possessed me, and the fire of jealous love<br />
Raged through my veins, not turned as yet to hate&mdash;<br />
Too well I loved for that&mdash;but breeding in me<br />
Unfaith in him. Love, setting him so high<br />
And self so low, betrayed me, and I prayed,<br />
Constrained to hold him false, the immortal gods<br />
To make him love again.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i24">But still he came not.<br />
And still the maddening rumours worked, and still<br />
'Fair, young, and a king's daughter,' the same words<br />
Smote me and pierced me. Oh, there is no pain<br />
In Hades&mdash;nay, nor deepest Hell itself,<br />
Like that of jealous hearts, the torture-pain<br />
Which racked my life so long.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Till one fair morn<br />
There came a joyful message. 'He has come!<br />
And at the shrine upon the promontory,<br />
The fair white shrine upon the purple sea,<br />
He waits to do his solemn sacrifice<br />
To the immortal gods; and with him comes<br />
A young maid beautiful as Dawn.'</p>

<p class="v0 i33">Then I,<br />
Mingling despair with love, rapt in deep joy<br />
That he was come, plunged in the depths of hell<br />
That she came too, bethought me of the robe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span><br />
The Centaur gave me, and the words he spake,<br />
Forgetting the deep hatred in his eyes,<br />
And all but love, and sent a messenger<br />
Bidding him wear it for the sacrifice<br />
To the immortals, knowing not at all<br />
Whom Fate decreed the victim.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Shall my soul<br />
Forget the agonized message which he sent,<br />
Bidding me come? For that accursèd robe,<br />
Stained with the poisonous accursèd blood,<br />
Even in the midmost flush of sacrifice<br />
Clung to him a devouring fire, and ate<br />
The piteous flesh from his dear limbs, and stung<br />
His great soft soul to madness. When I came,<br />
Knowing it was my work, he bent on me,<br />
Wise as a god through suffering and the near<br />
Inevitable Death, so that no word<br />
Of mine was needed, such a tender look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span><br />
Of mild reproach as smote me. 'Couldst not thou<br />
Trust me, who never loved as I love thee?<br />
What need was there of magical arts to draw<br />
The love that never wavered? I have lived<br />
As he lives who through perilous paths must pass,<br />
And lifelong trials, striving to keep down<br />
The brute within him, born of too much strength<br />
And sloth and vacuous days; by difficult toils,<br />
Labours endured, and hard-fought fights with ill,<br />
Now vanquished, now triumphant; and sometimes,<br />
In intervals of too long labour, finding<br />
His nature grown too strong for him, falls prone<br />
Awhile a helpless prey, then once again<br />
Rises and spurns his chains, and fares anew<br />
Along the perilous ways. Dearest, I would<br />
That thou wert wedded to some knight who stayed<br />
At home within thy gates, and were content<br />
To see thee happy. But for me the fierce<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span><br />
Rude energies of life, the mighty thews,<br />
The god-sent hate of Wrong, these drove me forth<br />
To quench the thirst of battle. See, this maid,<br />
This is the bride I destined for our son<br />
Who grows to manhood. Do thou see to her<br />
When I am dead, for soon I know again<br />
The frenzy comes, and with it ceasing, death.<br />
Go, therefore, ere I harm thee when my strength<br />
Has lost its guidance. Thou wert rich in love,<br />
Be now as rich in faith. Dear, for thy wrong<br />
I do forgive thee.'</p>

<p class="v0 i20">When I saw the glare<br />
Of madness fire his eyes, and my ears heard<br />
The groans the torture wrung from his great soul,<br />
I fled with broken heart to the white shrine,<br />
And knelt in prayer, but still my sad ear took<br />
The agony of his cries.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">Then I who knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span><br />
There was no hope in god or man for me<br />
Who had destroyed my Love, and with him slain<br />
The champion of the suffering race of men,<br />
And knowing that my soul, though innocent<br />
Of blood, was guilty of unfaith and vile<br />
Mistrust, and wrapt in weakness like a cloak,<br />
And made the innocent tool of hate and wrong,<br />
Against all love and good; grown sick and filled<br />
With hatred of myself, rose from my knees,<br />
And went a little space apart, and found<br />
A gnarled tree on the cliff, and with my scarf<br />
Strangling myself, swung lifeless.</p>

<p class="v0 i35">But in death<br />
I found him not. For, building a vast pile<br />
Of scented woods on Oeta, as they tell,<br />
My hero with his own hand lighted it,<br />
And when the mighty pyre flamed far and wide<br />
Over all lands and seas, he climbed on it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span><br />
And laid him down to die; but pitying Zeus,<br />
Before the swift flames reached him, in a cloud<br />
Descending, snatched the strong brave soul to heaven,<br />
And set him mid the stars.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">Wherefore am I<br />
Of all the blameless shades within this place<br />
The most unhappy, if of blame, indeed,<br />
I bear no load. For what is Sin itself,<br />
But Error when we miss the road which leads<br />
Up to the gate of heaven? Ignorance!<br />
What if we be the cause of ignorance?<br />
Being blind who might have seen! Yet do I know<br />
But self-inflicted pain, nor stain there is<br />
Upon my soul such as they bear who know<br />
The dreadful scourge with which the stern judge still<br />
Lashes their sins. I am forgiven, I know,<br />
Who loved so much, and one day, if Zeus will,<br />
I shall go free from hence, and join my Lord,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span><br />
And be with him again."</p>

<p class="v0 i24">And straight I seemed,<br />
Passing, to look upon some scarce-spent life,<br />
Which knows to-day the irony of Fate<br />
In self-inflicted pain.</p>

<p class="v4 i24">Together clung<br />
The ghosts whom next I saw, bound three in one<br />
By some invisible bond. A sire of port<br />
God-like as Zeus, to whom on either hand<br />
A tender stripling clung. I knew them well,<br />
As all men know them. One fair youth spake low:<br />
"Father, it does not pain me now, to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span><br />
Drawn close to thee, and by a double bond,<br />
With this my brother." And the other: "Nay,<br />
Nor me, O father; but I bless the chain<br />
Which binds our souls in union. If some trace<br />
Of pain still linger, heed it not&mdash;'tis past:<br />
Still let us cling to thee."</p>

<p class="v0 i29">He with grave eyes<br />
Full of great tenderness, upon his sons<br />
Looked with the father's gaze, that is so far<br />
More sweet, and sad, and tender, than the gaze<br />
Of mothers,&mdash;now on this one, now on that,<br />
Regarding them. "Dear sons, whom on the earth<br />
I loved and cherished, it was hard to watch<br />
Your pain; but now 'tis finished, and we stand<br />
For ever, through all future days of time,<br />
Symbols of patient suffering undeserved,<br />
Endured and vanquished. Yet sad memory still<br />
Brings back our time of trial.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i31">For the day<br />
Broke fair when I, the dread Poseidon's priest,<br />
Joyous because the unholy strife was done,<br />
And seeing the blue waters now left free<br />
Of hostile keels&mdash;save where upon the verge<br />
Far off the white sails faded&mdash;rose at dawn,<br />
And white robed, and in garb of sacrifice,<br />
And with the sacred fillet round my brows,<br />
Stood at the altar; and behind, ye twain,<br />
Decked by your mother's hand with new-cleansed robes,<br />
And with fresh flower-wreathed chaplets on your curls,<br />
Attended, and your clear young voices made<br />
Music that touched your father's eyes with tears,<br />
If not the careless gods. I seem to hear<br />
Those high sweet accents mounting in the hymn<br />
Which rose to all the blessed gods who dwelt<br />
Upon the far Olympus&mdash;Zeus, the Lord,<br />
And Sovereign Heré, and the immortal choir<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span><br />
Of Deities, but chiefly to the dread<br />
Poseidon, him who sways the purple sea<br />
As with a sceptre, shaking the fixed earth<br />
With stress of thundering surges. By the shrine<br />
The meek-eyed victim, for the sacrifice,<br />
Stood with his gilded horns. The hymns were done,<br />
And I in act to strike, when all the crowd<br />
Who knelt behind us, with a common fear<br />
Cried, with a cry that well might freeze the blood,<br />
And then, with fearful glances towards the sea,<br />
Fled, leaving us alone&mdash;me, the high priest,<br />
And ye, the acolytes; forlorn of men,<br />
Alone, but with our god.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">But we stirred not:<br />
We could not flee, who in the solemn act<br />
Of worship, and the ecstasy which comes<br />
To the believer's soul, saw heaven revealed,<br />
The mysteries unveiled, the inner sky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span><br />
Which meets the enraptured gaze. How should we fear<br />
Who thus were god-encircled! So we stood<br />
While the long ritual spent itself, nor cast<br />
An eye upon the sea. Till as I came<br />
To that great act which offers up a life<br />
Before life's Lord, and the full mystery<br />
Was trembling to completion, quick I heard<br />
A stifled cry of agony, and knew<br />
My children's voices. And the father's heart,<br />
Which is far more than rite or service done<br />
By man for god, seeing that it is divine<br />
And comes from God to men&mdash;this rising in me,<br />
Constrained me, and I ceased my prayer, and turned<br />
To succour you, and lo! the awful coils<br />
Which crushed your lives already, bound me round<br />
And crushed me also, as you clung to me,<br />
In common death. Some god had heard the prayer,<br />
And lo! we were ourselves the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
The priest, the victim, the accepted life,<br />
The blood, the pain, the salutary loss.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Was it not better thus to cease and die<br />
Together in one blest moment, mid the flush<br />
And ecstasy of worship, and to know<br />
Ourselves the victims? They were wrong who taught<br />
That 'twas some jealous goddess who destroyed<br />
Our lives, revengeful for discovered wiles,<br />
Or hateful of our land. Not readily<br />
Should such base passions sway the immortal gods;<br />
But rather do I hold it sooth indeed<br />
That Zeus himself it was, who pitying<br />
The ruin he foreknew, yet might not stay,<br />
Since mightier Fate decreed it, sent in haste<br />
Those dreadful messengers, and bade them take<br />
The pious lives he loved, before the din<br />
Of midnight slaughter woke, and the fair town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span><br />
Flamed pitifully to the skies, and all<br />
Was blood and ruin. Surely it was best<br />
To die as we did, and in death to live,<br />
A vision for all ages of high pain<br />
Which passes into beauty, and is merged<br />
In one accordant whole, as discords merge<br />
In that great Harmony which ceaseless rings<br />
From the tense chords of life, than to have lived<br />
Our separate lives, and died our separate deaths,<br />
And left no greater mark than drops which rain<br />
Upon the unbounded sea. Those hosts which fell<br />
Before the Scæan gate upon the sand,<br />
Nor found a bard to sing their fate, but left<br />
Their bones to dogs and kites&mdash;were they more blest<br />
Than we who, in the people's sight before<br />
Ilium's unshattered towers, lay down to die<br />
Our swift miraculous death? Dear sons, and good,<br />
Dear children of my love, how doubly dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span><br />
For this our common sorrow; suffering weaves<br />
Not only chains of darkness round, but binds<br />
A golden glittering link, which though withdrawn<br />
Or felt no longer, knits us soul to soul,<br />
In indissoluble bonds, and draws our lives<br />
So close, that though the individual life<br />
Be merged, there springs a common life which grows<br />
To such dread beauty, as has power to take<br />
The sting from sorrow, and transform the pain<br />
Into transcendent joy: as from the storm<br />
The unearthly rainbow draws its myriad hues<br />
And steeps the world in fairness. All our lives<br />
Are notes that fade and sink, and so are merged<br />
In the full harmony of Being. Dear sons,<br />
Cling closer to me. Life nor Death has torn<br />
Our lives asunder, as for some, but drawn<br />
Their separate strands together in a knot<br />
Closer than Life itself, stronger than Death,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span><br />
Insoluble as Fate."</p>

<p class="v0 i20">Then they three clung<br />
Together&mdash;the strong father and young sons,<br />
And in their loving eyes I saw the Pain<br />
Fade into Joy, Suffering in Beauty lost,<br />
And Death in Love!</p>

<p class="v4 i19">By a still sullen pool,<br />
Into its dark depths gazing, lay the ghost<br />
Whom next I passed. In form, a lovely youth,<br />
Scarce passed from boyhood. Golden curls were his,<br />
And wide blue eyes. The semblance of a smile<br />
Came on his lip&mdash;a girl's but for the down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span><br />
Which hardly shaded it; but the pale cheek<br />
Was soft as any maiden's, and his robe<br />
Was virginal, and at his breast he bore<br />
The perfumed amber cup which, when March comes<br />
Gems the dry woods and windy wolds, and speaks<br />
The resurrection.</p>

<p class="v0 i18">Looking up, he said:<br />
"Methought I saw her then, my love, my fair,<br />
My beauty, my ideal; the dim clouds<br />
Lifted, methought, a little&mdash;or was it<br />
Fond Fancy only? For I know that here<br />
No sunbeam cleaves the twilight, but a mist<br />
Creeps over all the sky and fields and pools,<br />
And blots them; and I know I seek in vain<br />
My earth-sought beauty, nor can Fancy bring<br />
An answer to my thought from these blind depths<br />
And unawakened skies. Yet has use made<br />
The quest so precious, that I keep it here,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span><br />
Well knowing it is vain.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">On the old earth<br />
'Twas otherwise, when in fair Thessaly<br />
I walked regardless of all nymphs who sought<br />
My love, but sought in vain, whether it were<br />
Dryad or Naiad from the woods or streams,<br />
Or white-robed Oread fleeting on the side<br />
Of fair Olympus, echoing back my sighs,<br />
In vain, for through the mountains day by day<br />
I wandered, and along the foaming brooks,<br />
And by the pine-woods dry, and never took<br />
A thought for love, nor ever 'mid the throng<br />
Of loving nymphs who knew me beautiful<br />
I dallied, unregarding; till they said<br />
Some died for love of me, who loved not one.<br />
And yet I cared not, wandering still alone<br />
Amid the mountains by the scented pines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Till one fair day, when all the hills were still,<br />
Nor any breeze made murmur through the boughs,<br />
Nor cloud was on the heavens, I wandered slow,<br />
Leaving the nymphs who fain with dance and song<br />
Had kept me 'midst the glades, and strayed away<br />
Among the pines, enwrapt in fantasy,<br />
And by the beechen dells which clothe the feet<br />
Of fair Olympus, wrapt in fantasy,<br />
Weaving the thin and unembodied shapes<br />
Which Fancy loves to body forth, and leave<br />
In marble or in song; and so strayed down<br />
To a low sheltered vale above the plains,<br />
Where the lush grass grew thick, and the stream stayed<br />
Its garrulous tongue; and last upon the bank<br />
Of a still pool I came, where was no flow<br />
Of water, but the depths were clear as air,<br />
And nothing but the silvery gleaming side<br />
Of tiny fishes stirred. There lay I down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span><br />
Upon the flowery bank, and scanned the deep,<br />
Half in a waking dream.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">Then swift there rose,<br />
From those enchanted depths, a face more fair<br />
Than ever I had dreamt of, and I knew<br />
My sweet long-sought ideal: the thick curls,<br />
Like these, were golden, and the white robe showed<br />
Like this; but for the wondrous eyes and lips,<br />
The tender loving glance, the sunny smile<br />
Upon the rosy mouth, these knew I not,<br />
Not even in dreams; and yet I seemed to trace<br />
Myself within them too, as who should find<br />
His former self expunged, and him transformed<br />
To some high thin ideal, separate<br />
From what he was, by some invisible bar,<br />
And yet the same in difference. As I moved<br />
My arms to clasp her to me, lo! she moved<br />
Her eager arms to mine, smiled to my smile,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span><br />
Looked love to love, and answered longing eyes<br />
With longing. When my full heart burst in words,<br />
'Dearest, I love thee,' lo! the lovely lips,<br />
'Dearest, I love thee,' sighed, and through the air<br />
The love-lorn echo rang. But when I longed<br />
To answer kiss with kiss, and stooped my lips<br />
To her sweet lips in that long thrill which strains<br />
Soul unto soul, the cold lymph came between<br />
And chilled our love, and kept us separate souls<br />
Which fain would mingle, and the self-same heaven<br />
Rose, a blue vault above us, and no shade<br />
Of earthly thing obscured us, as we lay<br />
Two reflex souls, one and yet different,<br />
Two sundered souls longing to be at one.</p>

<p class="v1 i0">There, all day long, until the light was gone<br />
And took my love away, I lay and loved<br />
The image, and when night was come, 'Farewell,'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span><br />
I whispered, and she whispered back, 'Farewell,'<br />
With oh, such yearning! Many a day we spent<br />
By that clear pool together all day long.<br />
And many a clouded hour on the wet grass<br />
I lay beneath the rain, and saw her not,<br />
And sickened for her; and sometimes the pool<br />
Was thick with flood, and hid her; and sometimes<br />
Some cold wind ruffled those clear wells, and left<br />
But glimpses of her, and I rose at eve<br />
Unsatisfied, a cold chill in my limbs<br />
And fever at my heart: until, too soon!<br />
The summer faded, and the skies were hid,<br />
And my love came not, but a quenchless thirst<br />
Wasted my life. And all the winter long<br />
The bright sun shone not, or the thick ribbed ice<br />
Obscured her, and I pined for her, and knew<br />
My life ebb from me, till I grew too weak<br />
To seek her, fearing I should see no more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span><br />
My dear. And so the long dead winter waned<br />
And the slow spring came back.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">And one blithe day,<br />
When life was in the woods, and the birds sang,<br />
And soft airs fanned the hills, I knew again<br />
Some gleam of hope within me, and again<br />
With feeble limbs crawled forth, and felt the spring<br />
Blossom within me; and the flower-starred glades,<br />
The bursting trees, the building nests, the songs,<br />
The hurry of life revived me; and I crept,<br />
Ghost-like, amid the joy, until I flung<br />
My panting frame, and weary nerveless limbs,<br />
Down by the cold still pool.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">And lo! I saw<br />
My love once more, not beauteous as of old,<br />
But oh, how changed! the fair young cheek grown pale,<br />
The great eyes, larger than of yore, gaze forth<br />
With a sad yearning look; and a great pain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span><br />
And pity took me which were more than love,<br />
And with a loud and wailing voice I cried,<br />
'Dearest, I come again. I pine for thee,'<br />
And swift she answered back, 'I pine for thee;'<br />
'Come to me, oh, my own,' I cried, and she&mdash;<br />
'Come to me, oh, my own.' Then with a cry<br />
Of love I joined myself to her, and plunged<br />
Beneath the icy surface with a kiss,<br />
And fainted, and am here.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">And now, indeed,<br />
I know not if it was myself I sought,<br />
As some tell, or another. For I hold<br />
That what we seek is but our other self,<br />
Other and higher, neither wholly like<br />
Nor wholly different, the half-life the gods<br />
Retained when half was given&mdash;one the man<br />
And one the woman; and I longed to round<br />
The imperfect essence by its complement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span><br />
For only thus the perfect life stands forth<br />
Whole, self-sufficing. Worse it is to live<br />
Ill-mated than imperfect, and to move<br />
From a false centre, not a perfect sphere,<br />
But with a crooked bias sent oblique<br />
Athwart life's furrows. 'Twas myself, indeed,<br />
Thus only that I sought, that lovers use<br />
To see in that they love, not that which is,<br />
But that their fancy feigns, and view themselves<br />
Reflected in their love, yet glorified,<br />
And finer and more pure.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">Wherefore it is:<br />
All love which finds its own ideal mate<br />
Is happy&mdash;happy that which gives itself<br />
Unto itself, and keeps, through long calm years,<br />
The tranquil image in its eyes, and knows<br />
Fulfilment and is blest, and day by day<br />
Wears love like a white flower, nor holds it less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span><br />
Though sharp winds bite, or hot suns fade, or age<br />
Sully its perfect whiteness, but inhales<br />
Its fragrance, and is glad. But happier still<br />
He who long seeks a high goal unattained,<br />
And wearies for it all his days, nor knows<br />
Possession sate his thirst, but still pursues<br />
The fleeting loveliness&mdash;now seen, now lost,<br />
But evermore grown fairer, till at last<br />
He stretches forth his arms and takes the fair<br />
In one long rapture, and its name is Death."</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Thus he; and seeing me stand grave: "Farewell.<br />
If ever thou shouldst happen on a wood<br />
In Thessaly, upon the plain-ward spurs<br />
Of fair Olympus, take the path which winds<br />
Through the close vale, and thou shalt see the pool<br />
Where once I found my life. And if in Spring<br />
Thou go there, round the margin thou shalt know<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span><br />
These amber blooms bend meekly, smiling down<br />
Upon the crystal surface. Pluck them not.<br />
But kneel a little while, and breathe a prayer<br />
To the fair god of Love, and let them be.<br />
For in those tender flowers is hid the life<br />
That once was mine. All things are bound in one<br />
In earth and heaven, nor is there any gulf<br />
'Twixt things that live,&mdash;the flower that was a life,<br />
The life that is a flower,&mdash;but one sure chain<br />
Binds all, as now I know.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">If there are still<br />
Fair Oreads on the hills, say to them, sir,<br />
They must no longer pine for me, but find<br />
Some worthier lover, who can love again;<br />
For I have found my love."</p>

<p class="v0 i27">And to the pool<br />
He turned, and gazed with lovely eyes, and showed<br />
Fair as an angel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i17">Leaving him enwrapt<br />
In musings, to a gloomy pass I came<br />
Between dark rocks, where scarce a gleam of light,<br />
Not even the niggard light of that dim land,<br />
Might enter; and the soil was black and bare,<br />
Nor even the thin growths which scarcely clothed<br />
The higher fields might live. Hard by a cave<br />
Which sloped down steeply to the lowest depths,<br />
Whence dreadful sounds ascended, seated still,<br />
Her head upon her hands, I saw a maid<br />
With eyes fixed on the ground&mdash;not Tartarus<br />
It was, but Hades; and she knew no pain,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span><br />
Except her painful thought. Yet there it seemed,<br />
As here, the unequal measure which awaits<br />
The adjustment, and meanwhile, inspires the strife<br />
Which rears life's palace walls; and fills the sail<br />
Which bears our bark across unfathomed seas,<br />
To its last harbour; this bore sway there too,<br />
And 'twas a luckless shade which sat and wept<br />
Amid the gloom, though blameless. Suddenly,<br />
She raised her head, and lo! the long curls, writhed<br />
Tangled, and snake-like&mdash;as the dripping hair<br />
Of a dead girl who freed from life and shame,<br />
From out the cruel wintry flow, is laid<br />
Stark on the snow with dreadful staring eyes<br />
Like hers. For when she raised her eyes to mine,<br />
They chilled my blood, so great a woe they bore;<br />
And as she gazed, wide-eyed, I knew my pulse<br />
Beat slow, and my limbs stiffen. Then they wore,<br />
At length, a softer look, and life revived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span><br />
Within my breast as thus she softly spoke:</p>

<p class="v1 i2">"Nay, friend, I would not harm thee. I have known<br />
Great sorrow, and sometimes it racks me still,<br />
And turns me into stone, and makes my eyes<br />
As dreadful as of yore; and yet it comes<br />
But seldom, as thou sawest, now, for Time<br />
And Death have healing hands. Only I love<br />
To sit within the darkness here, nor face<br />
The throng of happier ghosts; if any ghost<br />
Of happiness come here. For on the earth<br />
They wronged me bitterly, and turned to stone<br />
My heart, till scarce I knew if e'er I was<br />
The happy girl of yore.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">That youth who dreams<br />
Up yonder by the margin of the lake,<br />
Knew but a cold ideal love, but me<br />
Love in unearthly guise, but bodily form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span><br />
Seized and betrayed.</p>

<p class="v0 i21">I was a priestess once,<br />
Of stern Athené, doing day by day<br />
Due worship; raising, every dawn that came,<br />
My cold pure hymns to take her virgin ear;<br />
Nor sporting with the joyous company<br />
Of youths and maids, who at the neighbouring shrine<br />
Of Aphrodité served. Nor dance nor song<br />
Allured me, nor the pleasant days of youth<br />
And twilights 'mid the vines. They held me cold<br />
Who were my friends in childhood. For my soul<br />
Was virginal, and at the virgin shrine<br />
I knelt, athirst for knowledge. Day by day<br />
The long cold ritual sped, the liturgies<br />
Were done, the barren hymns of praise went up<br />
Before the goddess, and the ecstasy<br />
Of faith possessed me wholly, till almost<br />
I knew not I was woman. Yet I knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span><br />
That I was fair to see, and fit to share<br />
Some natural honest love, and bear the load<br />
Of children like the rest; only my soul<br />
Was lost in higher yearnings.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Like a god,<br />
He burst upon those pallid lifeless days,<br />
Bringing fresh airs and salt, as from the sea,<br />
And wrecked my life. How should a virgin know<br />
Deceit, who never at the joyous shrine<br />
Of Cypris knelt, but ever lived apart,<br />
And so grew guilty? For if I had spent<br />
My days among the throng, either my fault<br />
Were blameless, or undone. For innocence<br />
The tempter spreads his net. For innocence<br />
The gods keep all their terrors. Innocence<br />
It is that bears the burden, which for guilt<br />
Is lightened, and the spoiler goes his way,<br />
Uncaring, joyous, leaving her alone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span><br />
The victim and unfriended.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">Was it just<br />
In her, my mistress, who had had my youth,<br />
To wreak such vengeance on me? I had erred,<br />
It may be; but on him, whose was the guilt,<br />
No heaven-sent vengeance lighted, but he sped<br />
Away to other hearts across the deep,<br />
Careless and free; but me, the cold stern eyes<br />
Of the pure goddess withered; and the scorn<br />
Of maids, despised before, and the great blank<br />
Of love, whose love was gone&mdash;this wrung my heart,<br />
And froze my blood; set on my brow despair,<br />
And turned my gaze to stone, and filled my eyes<br />
With horror, and stiffened the soft curls which once<br />
Lay smooth and fair into such snake-like rings<br />
As made my aspect fearful. All who saw,<br />
Shrank from me and grew cold, and felt the warm,<br />
Full tide of life freeze in them, seeing in me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span><br />
Love's work, who sat wrapt up and lost in shame,<br />
As in a cloak, consuming my own heart,<br />
And was in hell already. As they gazed<br />
Upon me, my despair looked forth so cold<br />
From out my eyes, that if some spoiler came<br />
Fresh from his wickedness, and looked on them,<br />
Their glare would strike him dead; and those fair curls<br />
Which once the accursèd toyed with, grew to be<br />
The poisonous things thou seest; and so, with hate<br />
Of man's injustice and the gods', who knew<br />
Me blameless, and yet punished me; and sick<br />
Of life and love, and loathing earth and sky,<br />
And feeding on my sorrow, Hate at last<br />
Left me a Fury.</p>

<p class="v0 i16">Ah, the load of life<br />
Which lives for hatred! We are made to love&mdash;<br />
We women, and the injury which turns<br />
The honey of our lives to gall, transforms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span><br />
The angel to the fiend. For it is sweet<br />
To know the dreadful sense of strength, and smite<br />
And leave the tyrant dead with a glance; ay! sweet,<br />
In that fierce lust of power, to slay the life<br />
Which harmed not, when the suppliants' cry ascends<br />
To ears which hate has deafened. So I lived<br />
Long time in misery; to my sleepless eyes<br />
No healing slumbers coming; but at length,<br />
Zeus and the goddess pitying, I knew<br />
Soft rest once more veiling my dreadful gaze<br />
In peaceful slumbers. Then a blessed dream<br />
I dreamt. For, lo! a god-like knight in mail<br />
Of gold, who sheared with his keen flashing blade;<br />
With scarce a pang of pain, the visage cold<br />
Which too great sorrow left me; at one stroke<br />
Clean from the trunk, and then o'er land and sea,<br />
Invisible, sped with winged heels, to where,<br />
Upon a sea-worn cape, a fair young maid,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span><br />
More blameless even than I was, chained and bound,<br />
Waited a monster from the deep and stood<br />
In innocent nakedness. Then, as he rose,<br />
Loathsome, from out the depths, a monstrous growth,<br />
A creature wholly serpent, partly man,<br />
The wrongs that I had known, stronger than death,<br />
Rose up with such black hate in me again,<br />
And wreathed such hissing poison through my hair,<br />
And shot such deadly glances from my eyes,<br />
That nought that saw might live. And the vile worm<br />
Was slain, and she delivered. Then I dreamt<br />
My mistress, whom I thought so stern to me,<br />
Athené, set those dreadful staring eyes,<br />
And that despairing visage, on her shield<br />
Of chastity, and bears it evermore<br />
To fright the waverer from the wrong he would,<br />
And strike the unrepenting spoiler, dead.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>"</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then for a little paused she, while I saw<br />
Again her eyes grown dreadful, till once more,<br />
And with a softer glance:</p>

<p class="v0 i26">"From that blest dream<br />
I woke not on the earth, but only here.<br />
And now my pain is lightened since I know<br />
My dream, which was a dream within the dream<br />
Which is our life, fulfilled. And I have saved<br />
Another through my suffering, and through her<br />
A people. Oh, strange chain of sacrifice,<br />
That binds an innocent life, and from its blood<br />
And sorrow works out joy! Oh, mystery<br />
Of pain and evil! wrong grown salutary,<br />
And mighty to redeem! If thou shouldst see<br />
A woman on the earth, who pays to-day<br />
Like penalty of sin, and the new gods<br />
(For after Saturn, Zeus ruled; after him<br />
It may be there are others) love to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span><br />
The tender heart of girlhood, and to immure<br />
Within a cold and cloistered cell the life<br />
Which nature meant to bless, and if Love come<br />
Hold her accursèd; or to some poor maid,<br />
Forlorn and trusting, still the tempter comes<br />
And works his wrong, and leaves her in despair<br />
And shame and all abhorrence, while he goes<br />
His way unpunished,&mdash;if thou know her eyes<br />
Freeze thee like mine&mdash;oh! bid her lose her pain<br />
In succouring others&mdash;say to her that Time<br />
And Death have healing hands, and here there comes<br />
To the forgiven transgressor only pain<br />
Enough to chasten joy!"</p>

<p class="v0 i24">And a soft tear<br />
Trembled within her eyes, and her sweet gaze<br />
Was as the Magdalen's, the horror gone<br />
And a great radiance come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i27">Then as I passed<br />
To upper air, I saw two figures rise<br />
Together, one a woman with a grave<br />
Fair face not all unhappy, and the robes<br />
And presence of a queen; and with her walked<br />
The fairest youth that ever maiden's dream<br />
Conceived. And as they came, the throng of ghosts,<br />
For these who were not wholly ghosts, arose,<br />
And did them homage. Not the chain of love<br />
Bound them, but such calm kinship as is bred<br />
Of long and difficult pilgrimages borne<br />
Through common perils by two souls which share<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span><br />
A common weary exile. Nor as ghosts<br />
These showed, but rather like two lives which hung<br />
Suspended in a trance. A halo of life<br />
Played round them, and they brought a sweet brisk air<br />
Tasting of earth and heaven, like sojourners<br />
Who stayed but for awhile, and knew a swift<br />
Release await them. First the youth it was<br />
Who spake thus as they passed:</p>

<p class="v0 i31">"Dread Queen, once more<br />
I feel life stir within me, and my blood<br />
Run faster, while a new strange cycle turns<br />
And grows completed. Soon on the dear earth<br />
Under the lively light of fuller day,<br />
I shall revive me of my wound; and thou,<br />
Passing with me yon cold and lifeless stream,<br />
And the grim monster who will fawn on thee,<br />
Shalt issue in royal pomp, and wreathed with flowers,<br />
Upon the cheerful earth, leaving behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span><br />
A deeper winter for the ghosts who dwell<br />
Within these sunless haunts; and I shall lie<br />
Once more within loved arms, and thou shalt see<br />
Thy early home, and kiss thy mother's cheek,<br />
And be a girl again. But not for long;<br />
For ere the bounteous Autumn spreads her hues<br />
Of gold and purple, a cold voice will call<br />
And bring us to these wintry lands once more,<br />
As erst so often. Blest are we, indeed,<br />
Above the rest, and yet I would I knew<br />
The careless joys of old.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">For in hot youth,<br />
Oh, it was sweet to greet the balmy night<br />
That was love's nurse, and feel the weary eyes<br />
Closed by soft kisses,&mdash;sweet at early dawn<br />
To wake refreshed and, scarce from loving arms<br />
Leaping, to issue forth, with winding horn,<br />
By dewy heath and brake, and taste the fair<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span><br />
Young breath of early morning; and 'twas sweet<br />
To chase the bounding quarry all day long<br />
With my true hounds and rapid steed, and gay<br />
Companions of my youth, and with the eve<br />
To turn home laden with the spoil, and take<br />
The banquet which awaited, and sweet wine<br />
Poured out, and kisses pressed on loving lips;<br />
Circled by snowy arms. Oh, it was sweet<br />
To be alive and young!</p>

<p class="v0 i23">For sure it is<br />
The gods gave not quick pulses and hot blood<br />
And strength and beauty for no end, but would<br />
That we should use them wisely; and the fair,<br />
Sweet mistress of my service was, indeed,<br />
Worthy of all observance. Oh, her eyes<br />
When I lay bleeding! All day long we rode,<br />
I and my youthful peers, with horse and hound,<br />
And knew the joy of swift pursuit and toil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span><br />
And peril. At the last, a fierce boar turned<br />
At bay, and with his gleaming tusks o'erthrew<br />
My steed, and as I fell upon the flowers,<br />
Pierced me as with a sword. Then, as I lay,<br />
I knew the strange slow chill which, stealing, tells<br />
The young that it is death. Yet knew I not<br />
Of pain or fear, only great pity, indeed,<br />
That she should lose her love, who was so fond<br />
And gracious. But when, lifting my dim gaze,<br />
I saw her bend o'er me,&mdash;the lovely eyes<br />
Suffused with tears, and her sweet smile replaced<br />
By agonized sorrow,&mdash;for a while I stayed<br />
Life's ebbing tide, and raised my cold, white lips,<br />
With a faint smile, to hers. Then, with a kiss&mdash;<br />
One long last kiss, we mingled, and I knew<br />
No more.</p>

<p class="v0 i9">But even in death, so strong is Love,<br />
I could not wholly die; and year by year,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span><br />
When the bright springtime comes, and the earth lives,<br />
Love opens these dread gates, and calls me forth<br />
Across the gulf. Not here, indeed, she comes,<br />
Being a goddess and in heaven, but smooths<br />
My path to the old earth, where still I know<br />
Once more the sweet lost days, and once again<br />
Blossom on that soft breast, and am again<br />
A youth, and rapt in love; and yet not all<br />
As careless as of yore; but seem to know<br />
The early spring of passion, tamed by time<br />
And suffering, to a calmer, fuller flow,<br />
Less fitful, but more strong."</p>

<p class="v0 i31">Then the sad Queen<br />
"Fair youth, thy lot I know, for I am old<br />
As the old earth and yet as young as is<br />
The budding spring, and I was here a Queen,<br />
When Love was not or Time, and to my arms<br />
Thou camest as a little child, to dwell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span><br />
Within the halls of Death, for without Death<br />
There were nor Birth nor Love, nor would Life yearn<br />
To lose itself within another life,<br />
And dying, to be born. I, too, have died<br />
For love in part, and live again through love;<br />
For in the far-off years, when Time was young,<br />
And Love unborn on earth, and Zeus in heaven<br />
Ruled, a young sovereign; I, a maiden, dwelt<br />
With dread Demeter on the lovely plains<br />
Of sunny Sicily. There, day by day,<br />
I sported with the maiden goddesses,<br />
In virgin freedom. Budding age made gay<br />
Our lightsome feet, and on the flowery slopes<br />
We wandered daily, gathering flowers to weave<br />
In careless garlands for our locks, and passed<br />
The days in innocent gladness. Thought of Love<br />
There came not to us, for as yet the earth<br />
Was virginal, nor yet had Eros come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span><br />
With his delicious pain.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">And one fair morn&mdash;<br />
Not all the ages blot it&mdash;on the side<br />
Of Ætna we were straying. There was then<br />
Summer nor winter, springtide nor the time<br />
Of harvest, but the soft unfailing sun<br />
Shone always, and the sowing time was one<br />
With reaping; fruit and flower together sprung<br />
Upon the trees; and blade and ripened ear<br />
Together clothed the plains. There, as I strayed,<br />
Sudden a black cloud down the rugged side<br />
Of Ætna, mixed with fire and dreadful sound<br />
Of thunder, rolled around me, and I heard<br />
The maids who were my fellows turn and flee<br />
With shrieks and cries for me.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">But I, I knew<br />
No terror while the god o'ershadowed me,<br />
Hiding my life in his, nor when I wept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span><br />
My flowers all withered, and my blood ran slow<br />
Within a wintry land. Some voice there was<br />
Which said, 'Fear not. Thou shalt return and see<br />
Thy mother again, only a little while<br />
Fate wills that thou shouldst tarry, and become<br />
Queen of another world. Thou seest that all<br />
Thy flowers are faded. They shall live again<br />
On earth, as thou shalt, as thou livest now<br />
The Life of Death&mdash;for what is Death but Life<br />
Suspended as in sleep? The changeless rule<br />
Where life was constant, and the sun o'erhead,<br />
Blazed forth for ever, changes and is hidden<br />
Awhile. This region which thou seest, where all<br />
The trees are lifeless, and the flowers are dead,<br />
Is but the self-same earth on which erewhile<br />
Thou sportedst fancy free.'</p>

<p class="v0 i28">So, without fear<br />
I wandered on this bare land, seeing far<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span><br />
Upon the sky the peaks of my own hills<br />
And crests of my own woods. Till, when I grew<br />
Hungered, ere yet another form I saw;<br />
Along the silent alleys journeying,<br />
And leafless groves; a fair and mystic tree<br />
Rose like a heart in shape, and 'mid its leaves<br />
One golden mystic fruit with a fair seed<br />
Hid in it. This, with childish hand, I took<br />
And ate, and straight I knew the tree was Life,<br />
And the fruit Death, and the hid seed was Love.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Ah, sweet strange fruit! the which if any taste<br />
They may no longer keep their lives of old<br />
Or their own selves unchanged, but some weird change<br />
And subtle alchemy comes which can transmute<br />
The blood, and mould the spirits of gods and men<br />
In some new magical form. Not as before,<br />
Our life comes to us, though the passion cools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span><br />
No, never as before. My mother came<br />
Too late to seek me. She had power to raise<br />
A life from out Death's grasp, but from the arms<br />
Of Love she might not take me, nor undo<br />
Love's past for all her strength. She came and sought<br />
With fires her daughter over land and sea,<br />
Beyond the paths of all the setting stars,<br />
In vain, and over all the earth in vain,<br />
Seeking whom love disguised. Then on all lands<br />
She cast the spell of barrenness; the wheat<br />
Was blighted in the ear, the purple grapes<br />
Blushed no more on the vines, and all the gods<br />
Were sorrowful, seeing the load of ill<br />
My rape had laid on men. Last, Zeus himself,<br />
Pitying the evil that was done, sent forth<br />
His messenger beyond the western rim<br />
To fetch me back to earth.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">But not the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span><br />
He found me who had eaten of Love's seed,<br />
But changed into another; nor could his power<br />
Prevail to keep me wholly on the earth,<br />
Or make me maid again. The wintry life<br />
Is homelier often than the summer blaze<br />
Of happiness unclouded; so, when Spring<br />
Comes on the world, I, coming, cross with thee,<br />
Year after year, the cruel icy stream;<br />
And leave this anxious sceptre and the shades<br />
Of those in hell, or those for whom, though blest,<br />
No Spring comes, till the last great Spring which brings<br />
New heavens and new earth; and lay my head<br />
Upon my mother's bosom, and grow young,<br />
And am a girl again.</p>

<p class="v0 i21">A soft air breathes<br />
Across the stream and fills these barren fields<br />
With the sweet odours of the earth. I know<br />
Again the perfume of the violets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span><br />
Which bloom on Ætna's side. Soon we shall pass<br />
Together to our home, while round our feet<br />
The crocus flames like gold, the wind-flowers white<br />
Wave their soft petals on the breeze, and all<br />
The choir of flowers lift up their silent song<br />
To the unclouded heavens. Thou, fair boy,<br />
Shalt lie within thy love's white arms again,<br />
And I within my mother's. Sweet is Love<br />
In ceasing and renewal; nay, in these<br />
It lives and has its being. Thou couldst not keep<br />
Thy youth as now, if always on the breast<br />
Of love too late a lingerer thou hadst known<br />
Possession sate thee. Nor might I have kept<br />
My mother's heart, if I had lived to ripe<br />
And wither on the stalk. Time calls and Change<br />
Commands both men and gods, and speeds us on<br />
We know not whither; but the old earth smiles<br />
Spring after Spring, and the seed bursts again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span><br />
Out of its prison mould, and the dead lives<br />
Renew themselves, and rise aloft and soar<br />
And are transformed, clothing themselves with change<br />
Till the last change be done."</p>

<p class="v0 i31">As thus she spake,<br />
I saw a gleam of light flash from the eyes<br />
Of all the listening shades, and a great joy<br />
Thrill through the realms of Death.</p>

<p class="v4 i36">And then again<br />
A youthful shade I saw, a comely boy,<br />
With lip and cheek just touched with manly down,<br />
And strong limbs wearing Spring; in mien and garb<br />
A youthful chieftain, with a perfect face<br />
Of fresh young beauty, clustered curls divine,<br />
And chiselled features like a sculptured god,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span><br />
But warm and breathing life; only the eyes,<br />
The fair large eyes, were full of dreaming thought,<br />
And seemed to gaze beyond the world of sight,<br />
On a hid world of beauty. Him I stayed,<br />
Accosting with soft words of courtesy;<br />
And, on a bank of scentless flowers reclined,<br />
He answered thus:</p>

<p class="v0 i18">"Not for the garish sun<br />
I long, nor for the splendours of high noon<br />
In this dim land I languish; for of yore<br />
Full often, when the swift chase swept along<br />
Through the brisk morn, or when my comrades called<br />
To wrestling, or the foot-race, or to cleave<br />
The sunny stream, I loved to walk apart,<br />
Self-centred, sole; and when the laughing girls<br />
To some fair stripling's oaten melody<br />
Made ready for the dance, I heeded not;<br />
Nor when to the loud trumpet's blast and blare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span><br />
My peers rode forth to battle. For, one eve,<br />
In Latmos, after a long day in June,<br />
I stayed to rest me on a sylvan hill,<br />
Where often youth and maid were wont to meet<br />
Towards moonrise; and deep slumber fell on me<br />
Musing on Love, just as the ruddy orb<br />
Rose on the lucid night, set in a frame<br />
Of blooming myrtle and sharp tremulous plane;<br />
Deep slumber fell, and loosed my limbs in rest.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then, as the full orb poised upon the peak,<br />
There came a lovely vision of a maid,<br />
Who seemed to step as from a golden car<br />
Out of the low-hung moon. No mortal form,<br />
Such as ofttimes of yore I knew and clasped<br />
At twilight 'mid the vines at the mad feast<br />
Of Dionysus, or the fair maids cold<br />
Who streamed in white processions to the shrine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span><br />
Of the chaste Virgin Goddess; but a shape<br />
Richer and yet more pure. No thinnest veil<br />
Obscured her; but each exquisite limb revealed,<br />
Gleamed like a golden statue subtly wrought<br />
By a great sculptor on the architrave<br />
Of some high temple-front&mdash;only in her<br />
The form was soft and warm, and charged with life,<br />
And breathing. As I seemed to gaze on her,<br />
Nearer she drew and gazed; and as I lay<br />
Supine, as in a spell, the radiance stooped<br />
And kissed me on the lips, a chaste, sweet kiss,<br />
Which drew my spirit with it. So I slept<br />
Each night upon the hill, until the dawn<br />
Came in her silver chariot from the East,<br />
And chased my Love away. But ever thus<br />
Dissolved in love as in a heaven-sent dream,<br />
Whenever the bright circle of the moon<br />
Climbed from the hills, whether in leafy June<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span><br />
Or harvest-tide, or when they leapt and pressed<br />
Red-thighed the spouting must, I walked apart<br />
From all, and took no thought for mortal maid,<br />
Nor nimble joys of youth; but night by night<br />
I stole, when all were sleeping, to the hill,<br />
And slumbered and was blest; until I grew<br />
Possest by love so deep, I seemed to live<br />
In slumber only, while the waking day<br />
Showed faint as any vision.</p>

<p class="v0 i28">So I turned<br />
Paler and paler with the months, and climbed<br />
The steep with laboured steps and difficult breath,<br />
But still I climbed. Ay, though the wintry frost<br />
Chained fast the streams and whitened all the fields,<br />
I sought my mistress through the leafless groves,<br />
And slumbered and was happy, till the dawn<br />
Returning found me stretched out, cold and stark,<br />
With life's fire nigh burnt out. Till one clear night,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span><br />
When the birds shivered in the pines, and all<br />
The inner heavens stood open, lo! she came,<br />
Brighter and kinder still, and kissed my eyes<br />
And half-closed lips, and drew my soul through them,<br />
And in one precious ecstasy dissolved<br />
My life. And thenceforth, ever on the hill<br />
I lie unseen of man; a cold, white form,<br />
Still young, through all the ages; but my soul,<br />
Clothed in this thin presentment of old days,<br />
Walks this dim land, where never moonrise comes,<br />
Nor day-break, but a twilight waiting-time,<br />
No more; and, ah! how weary! Yet I judge<br />
My lot a higher far than his who spends<br />
His youth on swift hot pleasure, quickly past;<br />
Or theirs, my equals', who through long calm years<br />
Grew sleek in dull content of wedded lives<br />
And fair-grown offspring. Many a day for them,<br />
While I was wandering here, and my bones bleached<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span><br />
Upon the rocks, the sweet autumnal sun<br />
Beamed, and the grapes grew purple. Many a day<br />
They heaped up gold, they knelt at festivals,<br />
They waxed in high report and fame of men,<br />
They gave their girls in marriage; while for me<br />
Upon the untrodden peaks, the cold, grey morn,<br />
The snows, the rains, the winds, the untempered blaze,<br />
Beat year by year, until I turned to stone,<br />
And the great eagles shrieked at me, and wheeled<br />
Affrighted. Yet I judge it better indeed<br />
To seek in life, as now I know I sought,<br />
Some fair impossible Love, which slays our life,<br />
Some fair ideal raised too high for man;<br />
And failing to grow mad, and cease to be,<br />
Than to decline, as they do who have found<br />
Broad-paunched content and weal and happiness:<br />
And so an end. For one day, as I know,<br />
The high aim unfulfilled fulfils itself;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span><br />
The deep, unsatisfied thirst is satisfied;<br />
And through this twilight, broken suddenly,<br />
The inmost heaven, the lucent stars of God,<br />
The Moon of Love, the Sun of Life; and I,<br />
I who pine here&mdash;I on the Latmian hill<br />
Shall soar aloft and find them."</p>

<p class="v0 i33">With the word,<br />
There beamed a shaft of dawn athwart the skies,<br />
And straight the sentinel thrush within the yew<br />
Sang out reveillé to the hosts of day,<br />
Soldierly; and the pomp and rush of life<br />
Began once more, and left me there alone<br />
Amid the awaking world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i24">Nay, not alone.<br />
One fair shade lingered in the fuller day,<br />
The last to come, when now my dream had grown<br />
Half mixed with waking thoughts, as grows a dream<br />
In summer mornings when the broader light<br />
Dazzles the sleeper's eyes; and is most fair<br />
Of all and best remembered, and becomes<br />
Part of our waking life, when older dreams<br />
Grow fainter, and are fled. So this remained<br />
The fairest of the visions that I knew,<br />
Most precious and most dear.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">The increasing light<br />
Shone through her, finer than the thinnest shade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span><br />
And yet most full of beauty; golden wings,<br />
From her fair shoulders springing, seemed to lift<br />
Her stainless feet from the cold ground and snatch<br />
Their wearer into air; and in her eyes<br />
Was such fair glance as comes from virgin love,<br />
Long chastened and triumphant. Every trace<br />
Of earth had vanished from her, and she showed<br />
As one who walks a saint already in life,<br />
Virgin or mother. Immortality<br />
Breathed from those radiant eyes which yet had passed<br />
Between the gates of death. I seemed to hear<br />
The Soul of mortals speaking:</p>

<p class="v0 i30">"I was born<br />
Of a great race and mighty, and was grown<br />
Fair, as they said, and good, and kept a life<br />
Pure from all stain of passion. Love I knew not,<br />
Who was absorbed in duty; and the Mother<br />
Of gods and men, seeing my life more calm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span><br />
Than human, hating my impassive heart,<br />
Sent down her perfect son in wrath to earth,<br />
And bade him break me.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">But when Eros came,<br />
It did repent him of the task, for Love<br />
Is kin to Duty.</p>

<p class="v0 i16">And within my life<br />
I knew miraculous change, and a soft flame<br />
Wherefrom the snows of Duty flushed to rose,<br />
And the chill icy flow of mind was turned<br />
To a warm stream of passion. Long I lived<br />
Not knowing what had been, nor recognized<br />
A Presence walking with me through my life,<br />
As if by night, his face and form concealed:<br />
A gracious voice alone, which none but I<br />
Might hear, sustained me, and its name was Love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Not as the earthly loves which throb and flush<br />
Round earthly shrines was mine, but a pure spirit,<br />
Lovelier than all embodied love, more pure<br />
And wonderful; but never on his eyes<br />
I looked, which still were hidden, and I knew not<br />
The fashion of his nature; for by night,<br />
When visual eyes are blind, but the soul sees,<br />
Came he, and bade me seek not to enquire<br />
Or whence he came or wherefore. Nor knew I<br />
His name. And always ere the coming day,<br />
As if he were the Sun-god, lingering<br />
With some too well-loved maiden, he would rise<br />
And vanish until eve. But all my being<br />
Thrilled with my fair unearthly visitant<br />
To higher duty and more glorious meed<br />
Of action than of old, for it was Love<br />
That came to me, who might not know his name<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Thus, ever rapt by dreams divine, I knew<br />
The scorn that comes from weaker souls, which miss,<br />
Being too low of nature, the great joy<br />
Revealed to others higher; nay, my sisters,<br />
Who being of one blood with me, made choice<br />
To tread the lower ways of daily life,<br />
Grew jealous of me, bidding me take heed<br />
Lest haply 'twas some monstrous fiend I loved,<br />
Such as in fable ofttimes sought and won<br />
The innocent hearts of maids. Long time I held<br />
My love too dear for doubt, who was so sweet<br />
And lovable. But at the last the sneers,<br />
The mystery which hid him, the swift flight<br />
Before the coming dawn, the shape concealed,<br />
The curious girlish heart, these worked on me<br />
With an unsatisfied thirst. Not his own words:<br />
'Dear, I am with thee only while I keep<br />
My visage hidden; and if thou once shouldst see<br />
My face, I must forsake thee: the high gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span><br />
Link Love with Faith, and he withdraws himself<br />
From the full gaze of Knowledge'&mdash;not even these<br />
Could cure me of my longing, or the fear<br />
Those mocking voices worked; who fain would learn<br />
The worst that might befall.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">And one sad night,<br />
Just as the day leapt from the hills and brought<br />
The hour when he should go: with tremulous hands,<br />
Lighting my midnight lamp in fear, I stood<br />
Long time uncertain, and at length turned round<br />
And gazed upon my love. He lay asleep,<br />
And oh, how fair he was! The flickering light<br />
Fell on the fairest of the gods, stretched out<br />
In happy slumber. Looking on his locks<br />
Of gold, and faultless face and smile, and limbs<br />
Made perfect, a great joy and trembling took me<br />
Who was most blest of women, and in awe<br />
And fear I stooped to kiss him. One warm drop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
From the full lamp within my trembling hand,<br />
Or a glad tear from my too happy eyes,<br />
Fell on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="v0 i22">Then the god unclosed<br />
His lovely eyes, and with great pity spake:<br />
'Farewell! There is no Love except with Faith,<br />
And thine is dead! Farewell! I come no more.'<br />
And straightway from the hills the full red sun<br />
Leapt up, and as I clasped my love again,<br />
The lovely vision faded from his place,<br />
And came no more.</p>

<p class="v0 i18">Then I, with breaking heart,<br />
Knowing my life laid waste by my own hand,<br />
Went forth and would have sought to hide my life<br />
Within the stream of Death; but Death came not<br />
To aid me who not yet was meet for Death<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then finding that Love came not back to me,<br />
I thought that in the temples of the gods<br />
Haply he dwelt, and so from fane to fane<br />
I wandered over earth, and knelt in each,<br />
Enquiring for my Love; and I would ask<br />
The priests and worshippers, 'Is this Love's shrine?<br />
Sirs, have you seen the god?' But never at all<br />
I found him. For some answered, 'This is called<br />
The Shrine of Knowledge;' and another, 'This,<br />
The Shrine of Beauty;' and another, 'Strength;'<br />
And yet another, 'Youth.' And I would kneel<br />
And say a prayer to my Love, and rise<br />
And seek another. Long, o'er land and sea,<br />
I wandered, till I was not young or fair,<br />
Grown wretched, seeking my lost Love; and last,<br />
Came to the smiling, hateful shrine where ruled<br />
The queen of earthly love and all delight,<br />
Cypris, but knelt not there, but asked of one<br />
Who seemed her priest, if Eros dwelt with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then to the subtle-smiling goddess' self<br />
They led me. She with hatred in her eyes:<br />
'What! thou to seek for Love, who art grown thin<br />
And pale with watching! He is not for thee.<br />
What Love is left for such? Thou didst despise<br />
Love, and didst dwell apart. Love sits within<br />
The young maid's eyes, making them beautiful.<br />
Love is for youth, and joy, and happiness;<br />
And not for withered lives. Ho! bind her fast.<br />
Take her and set her to the vilest tasks,<br />
And bend her pride by solitude and tears,<br />
Who will not kneel to me, but dares to seek<br />
A disembodied love. My son has gone<br />
And left thee for thy fault, and thou shalt know<br />
The misery of my thralls.'</p>

<p class="v0 i27">Then in her house<br />
They bound me to hard tasks and vile, and kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span><br />
My life from honour, chained among her slaves<br />
And lowest ministers, taking despite<br />
And injury for food, and set to bind<br />
Their wounds whom she had tortured, and to feed<br />
The pitiful lives which in her prisons pent<br />
Languished in hopeless pain. There is no sight<br />
Of suffering but I saw it, and was set<br />
To succour it; and all my woman's heart<br />
Was torn with the ineffable miseries<br />
Which love and life have worked; and dwelt long time<br />
In groanings and in tears.</p>

<p class="v0 i27">And then, oh joy!<br />
Oh miracle! once more at length again<br />
I felt Love's arms around me, and the kiss<br />
Of Love upon my lips, and in the chill<br />
Of deepest prison cells, 'mid vilest tasks,<br />
The glow of his sweet breath, and the warm touch<br />
Of his invisible hand, and his sweet voice,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span><br />
Ay, sweeter than of old, and tenderer,<br />
Speak to me, pierce me, hold me, fold me round<br />
With arms Divine, till all the sordid earth<br />
Was hued like heaven, and Life's dull prison-house<br />
Turned to a golden palace, and those low tasks<br />
Grew to be higher works and nobler gains<br />
Than any gains of knowledge, and at last<br />
He whispered softly, 'Dear, unclose thine eyes.<br />
Thou mayst look on me now. I go no more,<br />
But am thine own for ever.'</p>

<p class="v0 i28">Then with wings<br />
Of gold we soared, I looking in his eyes,<br />
Over yon dark broad river, and this dim land,<br />
Scarce for an instant staying till we reached<br />
The inmost courts of heaven.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">But sometimes still<br />
I come here for a little, and speak a word<br />
Of peace to those who wait. The slow wheel turns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span><br />
The cycles round themselves and grow complete,<br />
The world's year whitens to the harvest-tide,<br />
And one word only am I sent to say<br />
To those dear souls, who wait here, or who now<br />
Breathe earthly air&mdash;one universal word<br />
To all things living, and the word is 'Love.'"</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then soared she visibly before my gaze,<br />
And the heavens took her, and I knew my eyes<br />
Had seen the soul of man, the deathless soul,<br />
Defeated, struggling, purified, and blest.</p>

<p class="v4 i2">Then all the choir of happy waiting shades,<br />
Heroes and queens, fair maidens and brave youths,<br />
Swept by me, rhythmic, slow, as if they trod<br />
Some unheard measure, passing where I stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span><br />
In fair procession, each with a faint smile<br />
Upon the lip, signing "Farewell, oh shade!<br />
It shall be well with thee, as 'tis with us,<br />
If only thou art true. The world of Life,<br />
The world of Death, are but opposing sides<br />
Of one great orb, and the Light shines on both.<br />
Oh, happy happy shade! Farewell! Farewell!"<br />
And so they passed away.</p>

<p class="v4 i25">But I, my gaze<br />
Following the soaring soul which now was lost<br />
In the awakening skies, floated with her,<br />
As in a trance, beyond the golden gates<br />
Which separate Earth from Heaven; and to my thought<br />
Gladdened by that broad effluence of light,<br />
This old earth seemed transfigured, and the fields,<br />
So dim and bare, grew green and clothed themselves<br />
With lustrous hues. A fine ethereal air<br />
Played round me as I mused, and filled the soul<br />
With an ineffable content. What need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span><br />
Of words to tell of things unreached by words?<br />
Or seek to engrave upon the treacherous thought<br />

Which vanish ere we fix them?</p>

<p class="v0 i30">But methinks<br />
He knows the scene, who knows the one fair day,<br />
One only and no more, which year by year<br />
In springtime comes, when lingering winter flies,<br />
And lo! the trees blossom in white and pink.<br />
And golden clusters, and the glades are filled<br />
With delicate primrose and deep odorous beds<br />
Of violets, and on the tufted meads<br />
With kingcups starred, and cowslip bells, and blue<br />
Sweet hyacinths, and frail anemones,<br />
The broad West wind breathes softly, and the air<br />
Is tremulous with the lark, and thro' the woods<br />
The soft full-throated thrushes all day long<br />
Flood the green dells with joy, and thro' the dry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span><br />
Brown fields the sower strides, sowing his seed,<br />
And all is life and song. Or he who first,<br />
Whether in fair free boyhood, when the world<br />
Is his to choose, or when his fuller life<br />
Beats to another life, or afterwards,<br />
Keeping his youth within his children's eyes,<br />
Looks on the snow-clad everlasting hills,<br />
And marks the sunset smite them, and is glad<br />
Of the beautiful fair world.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">A springtide land<br />
It seemed, where East winds came not. Sweetest song<br />
Was everywhere, by glade or sunny plain;<br />
And thro' the golden valleys winding streams<br />
Rippled in glancing silver, and above,<br />
The blue hills rose, and over all a peak,<br />
White, awful, with a constant fleece of cloud<br />
Veiling its summit, towered. Unfailing Day<br />
Lighted it, for no turn of dawn and eve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span><br />
Came there, nor changing seasons, but a broad<br />
Fixed joy of Being, undisturbed by Time.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">There, in a happy glade shut in by groves<br />
Of laurel and sweet myrtle, on a green<br />
And flower-lit lawn, I seemed to see the ghosts<br />
Of the old gods. Upon the gentle slope<br />
Of a fair hill, a joyous company,<br />
The Immortals lay. Hard by, a murmurous stream<br />
Fell through the flowers; below them, space on space,<br />
Laughed the immeasurable plains; beyond,<br />
The mystic mountain soared. Height after height<br />
Of bare rock ledges left the climbing pines,<br />
And reared their giddy, shining terraces<br />
Into the ethereal air. Above, the snows<br />
Of the white summit cleft the fleece of cloud<br />
Which always clothed it round.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">Ah, fail-and sweet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span><br />
Yet with a ghostly fairness, fine and thin,<br />
Those godlike Presences. Not dreams indeed,<br />
But something dream-like, were they. Blessed Shades<br />
Heroic and Divine, as when, in days<br />
When Man was young, and Time, the vivid thought<br />
Translated into Form the unattained<br />
Impossible Beauty of men's dreams, and fixed<br />
The Loveliness in marble.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">As with awe<br />
Following my spotless guide, I stood apart,<br />
Not daring to draw near; a shining form<br />
Rose from the throng, and floated, light as air,<br />
To where I trembled. And I knew the face<br />
And form of Artemis, the fair, the pure,<br />
The undefiled. A crescent silvery moon<br />
Shone thro' her locks, and by her side she bore<br />
A quiver of golden darts. At sight of whom<br />
I felt a sudden chill, like his who once<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span><br />
Looked upon her and died; yet could not fear,<br />
Seeing how fair she was. Her sweet voice rang<br />
Clear as a bird's:</p>

<p class="v0 i19">"Mortal, what fate hath brought<br />
Thee hither, uncleansed by death? How canst thou breathe<br />
Immortal air, being mortal? Yet fear not,<br />
Since thou art come. For we too are of earth<br />
Whom here thou seest: there were not a heaven<br />
Were there no earth, nor gods, had men not been,<br />
But each the complement of each and grown<br />
The other's creature, is and has its being,<br />
A double essence, Human and Divine.<br />
So that the God is hidden in the man,<br />
And something Human bounds and forms the God;<br />
Which else had shown too great and undefined<br />
For mortal sight, and having no human eye<br />
To see it, were unknown. But we who bore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span><br />
Sway of old time, we were but attributes<br />
<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>Of the great God who is all Things that be&mdash;<br />
The Pillar of the Earth and starry Sky,<br />
The Depth of the great Deep; the Sun, the Moon,<br />
The Word which Makes; the All-compelling Love&mdash;<br />
For all Things lie within His Infinite Form."</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Even as she spake, a throng of heavenly forms<br />
Floated around me, filling all my soul<br />
With fair unearthly beauty, and the air<br />
With such ambrosial perfume as is born.<br />
When morning bursts upon a tropic sea,<br />
From boundless wastes of flowers; and as I knelt<br />
In rapture, lo! the same clear voice again<br />
From out the throng of gods:</p>

<p class="v0 i29">"Those whom thou seest<br />
Were even as I, embodiments of Him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span><br />
Who is the Centre of all Life: myself<br />
The Maiden-Queen of Purity; and Strength,<br />
Divine when unabused; Love too, the Spring<br />
And Cause of Things; and Knowledge, which lays bare<br />
Their secret; and calm Duty, Queen of all,<br />
And Motherhood in one; and Youth, which bears,<br />
Beauty of Form and Life and Light, and breathes<br />
The breath of Inspiration; and the Soul,<br />
The particle of God, sent down to man,<br />
Which doth in turn reveal the world and God.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Wherefore it is men called on Artemis,<br />
The refuge of young souls; for still in age<br />
They keep some dim reflection uneffaced<br />
Of a Diviner Purity than comes<br />
To the spring days of youth, when all the world<br />
Smiles, and the rapid blood thro' the young veins<br />
Courses, and all is glad; yet knowing too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span><br />
That innocence is young&mdash;before the soil<br />
And smirch of sadder knowledge, settling on it,<br />
Sully its primal whiteness. So they knelt<br />
At my white shrines, the eager vigorous youths,<br />
To whom life's road showed like a dewy field<br />
In early summer dawns, when to the sound<br />
Of youth's clear voice, and to the cheerful rush<br />
Of the tumultuous feet and clamorous tongues<br />
Careering onwards, fair and dappled fawns,<br />
Strange birds with jewelled plumes, fierce spotted pards,<br />
Rise in the joyous chase, to be caught and bound<br />
By the young conqueror; nor yet the charm<br />
Of sensual ease allures. And they knelt too,<br />
The pure sweet maidens fair and fancy-free,<br />
Whose innocent virgin hearts shrank from the touch<br />
Of passion as from wrong&mdash;sweet moonlit lives<br />
Which fade, and pale, and vanish, in the glare<br />
Of Love's hot noontide: these came robed in white,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span><br />
With holy hymns and soaring liturgies:<br />
And so men fabled me, a huntress now,<br />
Borne thro' the flying woodlands, fair and free;<br />
And now the pale cold Moon, Light without warmth,<br />
Zeal without touch of passion, heavenly love<br />
For human, and the altar for the home.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">But oh, how sweet it was to take the love<br />
And awe of my young worshippers; to watch<br />
The pure young gaze and hear the pure young voice<br />
Mount in the hymn, or see the gay troop come<br />
With the first dawn of day, brushing the dew<br />
From the unpolluted fields, and wake to song<br />
The slumbering birds; strong in their innocence!<br />
I did not envy any goddess of all<br />
The Olympian company her votaries!<br />
Ah, happy days of old which now are gone!<br />
A memory and a dream! for now on earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span><br />
I rule no longer o'er young willing hearts<br />
In voluntary fealty, which should cease<br />
When Love, with fiery accents calling, woke<br />
The slumbering soul; as now it should for those<br />
Who kneel before the purer, sadder shrine<br />
Which has replaced my own. But ah! too oft,<br />
Not always, but too often, shut from life<br />
Within pale life-long cloisters and the bars<br />
Of deadly convent prisons, year by year,<br />
Age after age, the white souls fade and pine<br />
Which simulate the joyous service free<br />
Of those young worshippers. I would that I<br />
Might loose the captives' chain; or Herakles,<br />
Who was a mortal once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>"</p>

<p class="v4 i23">But he who stood<br />
Colossal at my side:</p>

<p class="v0 i21">"I toil no more<br />
On earth, nor wield again the mighty strength<br />
Which Zeus once gave me for the cure of ill.<br />
I have run my race; I have done my work; I rest<br />
For ever from the toilsome days I gave<br />
To the suffering race of men. And yet, indeed,<br />
Methinks they suffer still. Tyrannous growths<br />
And monstrous vex them still. Pestilence lurks<br />
And sweeps them down. Treacheries come, and wars,<br />
And slay them still. Vaulting ambition leaps<br />
And falls in bloodshed still. But I am here<br />
At rest, and no man kneels to me, or keeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span><br />
Reverence for strength mighty yet unabused&mdash;<br />
Strength which is Power, God's choicest gift, more rare<br />
And precious than all Beauty, or the charm<br />
Of Wisdom, since it is the instrument<br />
Thro' which all Nature works. For now the earth<br />
Is full of meekness, and a new God rules,<br />
Teaching strange precepts of humility<br />
And mercy and forgiveness. Yet I trow<br />
There is no lack of bloodshed and deceit<br />
And groanings, and the tyrant works his wrong<br />
Even as of old; but now there is no arm<br />
Like mine, made strong by Zeus, to beat him down,<br />
Him and his wrong together. Yet I know<br />
I am not all discrowned. The strong brave souls,<br />
The manly tender hearts, whom tale of wrong<br />
To woman or child, to all weak things and small,<br />
Fires like a blow; calling the righteous flush<br />
Of anger to the brow; knotting the cords<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span><br />
Of muscle on the arm; with one desire<br />
To hew the spoiler down, and make an end,<br />
And go their way for others; making light<br />
Of toil and pain, and too laborious days,<br />
And peril; beat unchanged, albeit they serve<br />
A Lord of meekness. For the world still needs<br />
Its champion as of old, and finds him still.<br />
Not always now with mighty sinews and thews<br />
Like mine, though still these profit, but keen brain<br />
And voice to move men's souls to love the right<br />
And hate the wrong; even tho' the bodily form<br />
Be weak, of giant strength, strong to assail<br />
The hydra heads of Evil, and to slay<br />
The monsters that now waste them: Ignorance,<br />
Self-seeking, coward fears, the hate of Man,<br />
Disguised as love of God. These there are still<br />
With task as hard as mine. For what was it<br />
To strive with bodily ills, and do great deeds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span><br />
Of daring and of strength, and bear the crown,<br />
To his who wages lifelong, doubtful strife<br />
With an impalpable foe; conquering indeed,<br />
But, ere he hears the pæan or sees the pomp<br />
Laid low in the arms of Death? And tho' men cease<br />
To worship at my shrine, yet not the less<br />
I hold, it is the toils I knew, the pains<br />
I bore for others, which have kept the heart<br />
Of manhood undefiled, and nerved the arm<br />
Of sacrifice, and made the martyr strong<br />
To do and bear, and taught the race of men<br />
How godlike 'tis to suffer thro' life, and die<br />
At last for others' good!"</p>

<p class="v0 i27">The strong god ceased,<br />
And stood a little, musing; blest indeed,<br />
But bearing, as it seemed, some faintest trace<br />
Of earthly struggle still, not the gay ease<br />
Of the elder heaven-born gods<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i30">And then there came<br />
Beauty and Joy in one, bearing the form<br />
Of woman. How to reach with halting words<br />
That infinite Perfection? All have known<br />
The breathing marbles which the Greek has left<br />
Who saw her near, and strove to fix her charms,<br />
And exquisitely failed; or those fair forms<br />
The Painter offered at a later shrine,<br />
And failed. Nay, what are words?&mdash;he knows it well<br />
Who loves, or who has loved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i29">She with a smile<br />
Playing around her rosy lips; as plays<br />
The sunbeam on a stream:</p>

<p class="v0 i25">"Shall I complain<br />
Men kneel to me no longer, taking to them<br />
Some graver, sterner worship; grown too wise<br />
For fleeting joys of Love? Nay, Love is Youth,<br />
And still the world is young. Still shall I reign<br />
Within the hearts of men, while Time shall last<br />
And Life renews itself. All Life that is,<br />
From the weak things of earth or sea or air,<br />
Which creep or float for an hour; to godlike man&mdash;<br />
All know me and are mine. I am the source<br />
And mother of all, both gods and men; the spring<br />
Of Force and Joy, which, penetrating all<br />
Within the hidden depths of the Unknown,<br />
Sets the blind seed of Being, and from the bond<br />
Of incomplete and dual Essences<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span><br />
Evolves the harmony which is Life. The world<br />
Were dead without my rays, who am the Light<br />
Which vivifies the world. Nay, but for me,<br />
The universal order which attracts<br />
Sphere unto sphere, and keeps them in their paths<br />
For ever, were no more. All things are bound<br />
Within my golden chain, whose name is Love.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And if there be, indeed, some sterner souls<br />
Or sunk in too much learning, or hedged round<br />
By care and greed, or haply too much rapt<br />
By pale ascetic fervours, to delight<br />
To kneel to me, the universal voice<br />
Scorns them as those who, missing willingly<br />
The good that Nature offers, dwell unblest<br />
Who might be blest, but would not. Every voice<br />
Of bard in every age has hymned me. All<br />
The breathing marbles, all the heavenly hues<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span><br />
Of painting, praise me. Even the loveless shades<br />
Of dim monastic cloisters show some gleam,<br />
Tho' faint, of me. Amid the busy throngs<br />
Of cities reign I, and o'er lonely plains,<br />
Beyond the ice-fields of the frozen North,<br />
And the warm waves of undiscovered seas.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For I was born out of the sparkling foam<br />
Which lights the crest of the blue mystic wave,<br />
Stirred by the wandering breath of Life's pure dawn<br />
From a young soul's calm depths. There, without voice,<br />
Stretched on the breathing curve of a young breast,<br />
Fluttering a little, fresh from the great deep<br />
Of life, and creamy as the opening rose,<br />
Naked I lie, naked yet unashamed,<br />
While youth's warm tide steals round me with a kiss,<br />
And floods each limb with fairness. Shame I know not&mdash;<br />
Shame is for wrong, and not for innocence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>&mdash;<br />
The veil which Error grasps to hide itself<br />
From the awful Eye. But I, I lie unveiled<br />
And unashamed&mdash;the livelong day I lie,<br />
The warm wave murmuring to me; and, all night,<br />
Hidden in the moonlit caves of happy Sleep,<br />
I dream until the morning and am glad.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Why should I seek to clothe myself, and hide<br />
The treasure of my Beauty? Shame may wait<br />
On those for whom 'twas given. The sties of sense<br />
Are none of mine; the brutish, loveless wrong,<br />
The venal charm, the simulated flush<br />
Of fleshly passion, they are none of mine,<br />
Only corruptions of me. Yet I know<br />
The counterfeit the stronger, since gross souls<br />
And brutish sway the earth; and yet I hold<br />
That sense itself is sacred, and I deem<br />
'Twere better to grow soft and sink in sense<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span><br />
Than gloat o'er blood and wrong.</p>

<p class="v0 i33">My kingdom is<br />
Over infinite grades of being. All breathing things,<br />
From the least crawling insect to the brute,<br />
From brute to man, confess me. Yet in man<br />
I find my worthiest worship. Where man is,<br />
A youth and a maid, a youth and a maid, nought else<br />
Is wanting for my temple. Every clime<br />
Kneels to me&mdash;the long breaker swells and falls<br />
Under the palms, mixed with the merry noise<br />
Of savage bridals, and the straight brown limbs<br />
Know me, and over all the endless plains<br />
I reign, and by the tents on the hot sand<br />
And sea-girt isles am queen, and on the side<br />
Of silent mountains, where the white cots gleam<br />
Upon the green hill pastures, and no sound<br />
But the thunder of the avalanche is borne<br />
To the listening rocks around; and in fair lands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span><br />
Where all is peace; where thro' the happy hush<br />
Of tranquil summer evenings, 'mid the corn,<br />
Or thro' cool arches of the gadding vines,<br />
The lovers stray together hand in hand,<br />
Hymning my praise; and by the stately streets<br />
Of echoing cities&mdash;over all the earth,<br />
Palace and cot, mountain and plain and sea,<br />
The burning South, the icy North, the old<br />
And immemorial East, the unbounded West,<br />
No new god comes to spoil me utterly&mdash;<br />
All worship and are mine!"</p>

<p class="v0 i27">With a sweet smile<br />
Upon her rosy mouth, the goddess ceased;<br />
And when she spake no more, the silence weighed<br />
As heavy on my soul as when it takes<br />
Some gracious melody, and leaves the ear<br />
Unsatisfied and longing, till the fount<br />
Of sweetness springs again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i28">But while I stood<br />
Expectant, lo! a fair pale form drew near<br />
With front severe, and wide blue eyes which bore<br />
Mild wisdom in their gaze. Great purity<br />
Shone from her&mdash;not the young-eyed innocence<br />
Of her whom first I saw, but that which comes<br />
From wider knowledge, which restrains the tide<br />
Of passionate youth, and leads the musing soul<br />
By the calm deeps of Wisdom. And I knew<br />
My eyes had seen the fair, the virgin Queen,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span><br />
Who once within her shining Parthenon<br />
Beheld the sages kneel.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">She with clear voice<br />
And coldly sweet, yet with a softness too,<br />
As doth befit a virgin:</p>

<p class="v0 i24">"She does right<br />
To boast her sway, my sister, seeing indeed<br />
That all things are as by a double law,<br />
And from a double root the tree of Life<br />
Springs up to the face of heaven. Body and Soul,<br />
Matter and Spirit, lower joys of Sense<br />
And higher joys of Thought, I know that both<br />
Build up the shrine of Being. The brute sense<br />
Leaves man a brute; but, winged with soaring thought<br />
Mounts to high heaven. The unembodied spirit,<br />
Dwelling alone, unmated, void of sense,<br />
Is impotent. And yet I hold there is,<br />
Far off, but not too far for mortal reach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span><br />
A calmer height, where, nearer to the stars,<br />
Thought sits alone and gazes with rapt gaze,<br />
A large-eyed maiden in a robe of white.<br />
Who brings the light of Knowledge down, and draws<br />
To her pontifical eyes a bridge of gold,<br />
Which spans from earth to heaven.</p>

<p class="v0 i34">For what were life,<br />
If things of sense were all, for those large souls<br />
And high, which grudging Nature has shut fast<br />
Within unlovely forms, or those from whom<br />
The circuit of the rapid gliding years<br />
Steals the brief gift of beauty? Shall we hold,<br />
With idle singers, all the treasure of hope<br />
Is lost with youth&mdash;swift-fleeting, treacherous youth,<br />
Which fades and flies before the ripening brain<br />
Crowns life with Wisdom's crown? Nay, even in youth,<br />
Is it not more to walk upon the heights<br />
Alone&mdash;the cold free heights&mdash;and mark the vale<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span><br />
Lie breathless in the glare, or hidden and blurred<br />
By cloud and storm; or pestilence and war<br />
Creep on with blood and death; while the soul dwells<br />
Apart upon the peaks, outfronts the sun<br />
As the eagle does, and takes the coming dawn<br />
While all the vale is dark, and knows the springs<br />
Of tiny rivulets hurrying from the snows,<br />
Which soon shall swell to vast resistless floods,<br />
And feed the Oceans which divide the World?</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Oh, ecstasy! oh, wonder! oh, delight!<br />
Which neither the slow-withering wear of Time,<br />
That takes all else&mdash;the smooth and rounded cheek<br />
Of youth; the lightsome step; the warm young heart<br />
Which beats for love or friend; the treasure of hope<br />
Immeasurable; the quick-coursing blood<br />
Which makes it joy to be,&mdash;ay, takes them all<br />
And leaves us naught&mdash;nor yet satiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span><br />
Born of too full possession, takes or mars!<br />
Oh, fair delight of learning! which grows great<br />
And stronger and more keen, for slower limbs,<br />
And dimmer eyes and loneliness, and loss<br />
Of lower good&mdash;wealth, friendship, ay, and Love&mdash;<br />
When the swift soul, turning its weary gaze<br />
From the old vanished joys, projects itself<br />
Into the void and floats in empty space,<br />
Striving to reach the mystic source of Things,<br />
The secrets of the earth and sea and air,<br />
The Law that holds the process of the suns,<br />
The awful depths of Mind and Thought; the prime<br />
Unfathomable mystery of God!</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Is there, then, any who holds my worship cold<br />
And lifeless? Nay, but 'tis the light which cheers<br />
The waning life! Love thou thy love, brave youth!<br />
Cleave to thy love, fair maid! it is the Law<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span><br />
Which dominates the world, that bids ye use<br />
Your nature; but, when now the fuller tide<br />
Slackens a little, turn your calmer eyes<br />
To the fair page of Knowledge. It is power<br />
I give, and power is precious. It is strength<br />
To live four-square, careless of outward shows,<br />
And self-sufficing. It is clearer sight<br />
To know the rule of life, the Eternal scheme;<br />
And, knowing it, to do and not to err,<br />
And, doing, to be blest."</p>

<p class="v0 i26">The calm voice soared<br />
Higher and higher to the close; the cold<br />
Clear accents, fired as by a hidden fire,<br />
Glowed into life and tenderness, and throbbed<br />
As with some spiritual ecstasy<br />
Sweeter than that of Love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i27">But as they died,<br />
I heard an ampler voice; and looking, marked<br />
A fair and gracious form. She seemed a Queen<br />
Who ruled o'er gods and men; the majesty<br />
Of perfect womanhood. No opening bud<br />
Of beauty, but the full consummate flower<br />
Was hers; and from her mild large eyes looked forth<br />
Gentle command, and motherhood, and home,<br />
And pure affection. Awe and reverence<br />
O'erspread me, as I knew my eyes had looked<br />
On sovereign Heré, mother of the gods.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">She, with clear, rounded utterance, sweet and calm<br />
"I know Love's fruit is good and fair to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span><br />
And taste, if any gain it, and I know<br />
How brief Life's Passion-tide, which when it ends<br />
May change to thirst for Knowledge, and I know<br />
How fair the realm of Mind, wherein the soul<br />
Thirsting to know, wings its impetuous way<br />
Beyond the bounds of Thought; and yet I hold<br />
There is a higher bliss than these, which fits<br />
A mortal life, compact of Body and Soul,<br />
And therefore double-natured&mdash;a calm path<br />
Which lies before the feet, thro' common ways<br />
And undistinguished crowds of toiling men,<br />
And yet is hard to tread, tho' seeming smooth,<br />
And yet, tho' level, earns a worthier crown.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For Knowledge is a steep which few may climb,<br />
While Duty is a path which all may tread.<br />
And if the Soul of Life and Thought be this,<br />
How best to speed the mighty scheme, which still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span><br />
Fares onward day by day&mdash;the Life of the World,<br />
Which is the sum of petty lives, that live<br />
And die so this may live&mdash;how then shall each<br />
Of that great multitude of faithful souls<br />
Who walk not on the heights, fulfil himself,<br />
But by the duteous Life which looks not forth<br />
Beyond its narrow sphere, and finds its work,<br />
And works it out; content, this done, to fall<br />
And perish, if Fate will, so the great Scheme<br />
Goes onward?</p>

<p class="v0 i13">Wherefore am I Queen in Heaven<br />
And Earth, whose realm is Duty, bearing rule<br />
More constant and more wide than those whose words<br />
Thou heardest last. Mine are the striving souls<br />
Of fathers toiling day by day obscure<br />
And unrewarded, save by their own hearts,<br />
Mid wranglings of the Forum or the mart;<br />
Who long for joys of Thought, and yet must toil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span><br />
Unmurmuring thro' dull lives from youth to age;<br />
Who haply might have worn instead the crown<br />
Of Honour and of Fame: mine the fair mothers<br />
Who, for the love of children and of home,<br />
When passion dies, expend their toilful years<br />
In loving labour sweetened by the sense<br />
Of Duty: mine the statesman who toils on<br />
Thro' vigilant nights and days, guiding his State.<br />
Yet finds no gratitude; and those white souls<br />
Who give themselves for others all their years<br />
In trivial tasks of Pity. The fine growths<br />
Of Man and Time are mine, and spend themselves<br />
For me and for the mystical End which lies<br />
Beyond their gaze and mine, and yet is good,<br />
Tho' hidden from men and gods.</p>

<p class="v0 i31">For as the flower<br />
Of the tiger-lily bright with varied hues<br />
Is for a day, then fades and leaves behind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span><br />
Fairness nor fruit, while the green tiny tuft<br />
Swells to the purple of the clustering grape<br />
Or golden waves of wheat; so lives of men<br />
Which show most splendid; fade and are deceased<br />
And leave no trace; while those, unmarked, unseen,<br />
Which no man recks of, rear the stately tree<br />
Of Knowledge, not for itself sought out, but found<br />
In the dusty ways of life&mdash;a fairer growth<br />
Than springs in cloistered shades; and from the sum<br />
Of Duty, blooms sweeter and more divine<br />
The fair ideal of the Race, than comes<br />
From glittering gains of Learning.</p>

<p class="v0 i35">Life, full life,<br />
Full-flowered, full-fruited, reared from homely earth,<br />
Rooted in duty, and thro' long calm years<br />
Bearing its load of healthful energies;<br />
Stretching its arms on all sides; fed with dews<br />
Of cheerful sacrifice, and clouds of care,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span><br />
And rain of useful tears; warmed by the sun<br />
Of calm affection, till it breathes itself<br />
In perfume to the heavens&mdash;this is the prize<br />
I hold most dear, more precious than the fruit<br />
Of Knowledge or of Love."</p>

<p class="v0 i26">The goddess ceased<br />
As dies some gracious harmony, the child<br />
Of wedded themes which single and alone<br />

Sweet as the sounds of heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i31">And then stood forth<br />
The last of the gods I saw, the first in rank<br />
And dignity and beauty, the young god<br />
Who grows not old, the Light of Heaven and Earth,<br />
The Worker from afar, who sends the fire<br />
Of inspiration to the bard and bathes<br />
The world in hues of heaven&mdash;the golden link<br />
Between High God and Man.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For Knowledge is a barren tree and bare,<br />
Bereft of God, and Duty but a word,<br />
And Strength but Tyranny, and Love, Desire,<br />
And Purity a folly; and the Soul,<br />
Which brings down God to Man, the Light to the world;<br />
He is the Maker, and is blest, is blest!"</p>

<p class="v1 i2">He ended, and I felt my soul grow faint<br />
With too much sweetness.</p>

<p class="v0 i25">In a mist of grace<br />
They faded, that bright company, and seemed<br />
To melt into each other and shape themselves<br />
Into new forms, and those fair goddesses<br />
Blent in a perfect woman&mdash;all the calm<br />
High motherhood of Heré, the sweet smile<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span><br />
Of Cypris, fair Athené's earnest eyes,<br />
And the young purity of Artemis,<br />
Blent in a perfect woman; and in her arms,<br />
Fused by some cosmic interlacing curves<br />
Of Beauty into a new Innocence,<br />
A child with eyes divine, a little child,<br />
A little child&mdash;no more.</p>

<p class="v0 i24">And those great gods<br />
Of Power and Beauty left a heavenly form<br />
Strong not to act, but suffer; fair and meek,<br />
Not proud and eager; with soft eyes of grace,<br />
Not bold with joyous youth; and for the fire<br />
Of song, and for the happy careless life,<br />
A sorrowful pilgrimage&mdash;changed, yet the same<br />
Only Diviner far; and keeping still<br />
The Life God-lighted and the sacrifice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And when these faded wholly, at my side,<br />
Tho' hidden before by those too-radiant forms,<br />
I was aware once more of her, my guide<br />
Psyche, who had not left me, floating near<br />
On golden wings; and all the plains of heaven<br />
Were left to us, me and my soul alone.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">Then when my thought revived again, I said<br />
Whispering, "But Zeus I saw not, the prime Source<br />
And Sire of all the gods."</p>

<p class="v0 i27">And she, bent low<br />
With downcast eyes: "Nay. Thou hast seen of Him<br />
All that thine eyes can bear, in those fair forms<br />
Which are but parts of Him and are indeed<br />
Attributes of the Substance which supports<br />
The Universe of Things&mdash;the Soul of the World,<br />
The Stream which flows Eternal, from no Source<br />
Into no Sea, His Purity, His Strength,<br />
His Love, His Knowledge, His unchanging rule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span><br />
Of Duty, thou hast seen, only a part<br />
And not the whole, being a finite mind<br />
Too weak for infinite thought; nor, couldst thou see<br />
All of Him visible to mortal sight,<br />
Wouldst thou see all His essence, since the gods&mdash;<br />
Glorified essences of Human mould,<br />
Who are but Zeus made visible to men&mdash;<br />
See Him not wholly, only some thin edge<br />
And halo of His glory; nor know they<br />
What vast and unsuspected Universes<br />
Lie beyond thought, where yet He rules, like those<br />
Vast Suns we cannot see, round which our Sun<br />
Moves with his system, or those darker still<br />
Which not even thus we know, but yet exist<br />
Tho' no eye marks, nor thought itself, and lurk<br />
In the awful Depths of Space; or that which is<br />
Not orbed as yet, but indiscrete, confused,<br />
Sown thro' the void&mdash;the faintest gleam of light<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span><br />
Which sets itself to Be. And yet is He<br />
There too, and rules, none seeing. But sometimes<br />
To this our heaven, which is so like to earth<br />
But nearer to Him, for awhile He shows<br />
Some gleam of His own brightness, and methinks<br />
It cometh soon; but thou, if thou shouldst gaze,<br />
Thy Life will rush to His&mdash;the tiny spark<br />
Absorbed in that full blaze&mdash;and what there is<br />
Of mortal fall from thee."</p>

<p class="v0 i27">But I: "Oh, soul,<br />
What holdeth Life more precious than to know<br />
The Giver and to die?"</p>

<p class="v0 i23">Then she: "Behold!<br />
Look upward and adore."</p>

<p class="v0 i23">And with the word,<br />
Unhasting, undelaying, gradual, sure,<br />
The floating cloud which clothed the hidden peak<br />
Rose slow in awful silence, laying bare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span><br />
Spire after rocky spire, snow after snow,<br />
Whiter and yet more dreadful, till at last<br />
It left the summit clear.</p>

<p class="v0 i26">Then with a bound,<br />
In the twinkling of an eye, in the flash of a thought,<br />
I knew an Awful Effluence of Light,<br />
Formless, Ineffable, Perfect, burst on me<br />
And flood my being round, and take my life<br />
Into itself. I saw my guide bent down<br />
Prostrate, her wings before her face; and then<br />
No more.</p>

<p class="v4 i9">But when I woke from my long trance<br />
Behold, it was no longer Tartarus,<br />
Nor Hades, nor Olympus, but the bare<br />
And unideal aspect of the fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span><br />
Which Spring not yet had kissed&mdash;the strange old Earth<br />
So far more fabulous now than in the days<br />
When Man was young, nor yet the mystery<br />
Of Time and Fate transformed it. From the hills,<br />
The long night fled at last, the unclouded sun,<br />
The dear, fair sun, leapt upward swift, and smote<br />
My sight with rays of gold, and pierced my brain<br />
With too much light ere my entrancèd eyes<br />
Could hide themselves.</p>

<p class="v0 i23">And I was on the Earth<br />
Dreaming the dream of Life again, as late<br />
I dreamed the dream of Death.</p>

<p class="v0 i30">Another day<br />
Dawned on the race of men; another world;<br />
New heavens, and new earth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v4 i28">And as I went<br />
Across the lightening fields, upon a bank<br />
I saw a single snowdrop glance, and bring<br />
Promise of Spring; and keeping my old thought<br />
In the old fair Hellenic vesture dressed,<br />
I felt myself a ghost, and seemed to be<br />
Now fair Adonis hasting to the arms<br />
Of his lost love&mdash;now sad Persephone<br />
Restored to mother earth&mdash;or that high shade<br />
Orpheus, who gave up heaven to save his love,<br />
And is rewarded&mdash;or young Marsyas,<br />
Who spent his youth and life for song, and yet<br />
Was happy though in torture&mdash;or the fair<br />
And dreaming youth I saw, who still awaits,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span><br />
Hopeful, the unveiling heaven, when he shall see<br />
His fair ideal love. The birds sang blithe;<br />
There came a tinkling from the waking fold;<br />
And on the hillside from the cot a girl<br />
Tripped singing with her pitcher. All the sounds<br />
And thoughts which still are beautiful&mdash;Youth, Song,<br />
Dawn, Spring, Renewal&mdash;and my soul was glad<br />
Of all the freshness, and I felt again<br />
The youth and spring-tide of the world, and thought,<br />
Which feigned those fair and gracious fantasies.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For every dawn that breaks brings a new world,<br />
And every budding bosom a new life;<br />
These fair tales, which we know so beautiful,<br />
Show only finer than our lives to-day<br />
Because their voice was clearer, and they found<br />
A sacred bard to sing them. We are pent,<br />
Who sing to-day, by all the garnered wealth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span><br />
Of ages of past song. We have no more<br />
The world to choose from, who, where'er we turn,<br />
Tread through old thoughts and fair. Yet must we sing&mdash;<br />
We have no choice; and if more hard the toil<br />
In noon, when all is clear, than in the fresh<br />
White mists of early morn, yet do we find<br />
Achievement its own guerdon, and at last<br />
The rounder song of manhood grows more sweet<br />
Than the high note of youth.</p>

<p class="v0 i29">For Age, long Age!<br />
Nought else divides us from the fresh young days<br />
Which men call ancient; seeing that we in turn<br />
Shall one day be Time's ancients, and inspire<br />
The wiser, higher race, which yet shall sing<br />
Because to sing is human, and high thought<br />
Grows rhythmic ere its close. Nought else there is<br />
But that weird beat of Time, which doth disjoin<br />
To-day from Hellas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p class="v0 i20">How should any hold<br />
Those precious scriptures only old-world tales<br />
Of strange impossible torments and false gods;<br />
Of men and monsters in some brainless dream,<br />
Coherent, yet unmeaning, linked together<br />
By some false skein of song?</p>

<p class="v0 i29">Nay! evermore,<br />
All things and thoughts, both new and old, are writ<br />
Upon the unchanging human heart and soul.<br />
Has Passion still no prisoners? Pine there now<br />
No lives which fierce Love, sinking into Lust,<br />
Has drowned at last in tears and blood&mdash;plunged down<br />
To the lowest depths of Hell? Have not strong Will<br />
And high Ambition rotted into Greed<br />
And Wrong, for any, as of old, and whelmed<br />
The struggling soul in ruin? Hell lies near<br />
Around us as does Heaven, and in the World,<br />
Which is our Hades, still the chequered souls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span><br />
Compact of good and ill&mdash;not all accurst<br />
Nor altogether blest&mdash;a few brief years<br />
Travel the little journey of their lives,<br />
They know not to what end. The weary woman<br />
Sunk deep in ease and sated with her life,<br />
Much loved and yet unloving, pines to-day<br />
As Helen; still the poet strives and sings.<br />
And hears Apollo's music, and grows dumb,<br />
And suffers, yet is happy; still the young<br />
Fond dreamer seeks his high ideal love,<br />
And finds her name is Death; still doth the fair<br />
And innocent life, bound naked to the rock,<br />
Redeem the race; still the gay tempter goes<br />
And leaves his victim, stone; still doth pain bind<br />
Men's souls in closer links of lovingness,<br />
Than Death itself can sever; still the sight<br />
Of too great beauty blinds us, and we lose<br />
The sense of earthly splendours, gaining Heaven<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And still the skies are opened as of old<br />
To the entrancèd gaze, ay, nearer far<br />
And brighter than of yore; and Might is there,<br />
And Infinite Purity is there, and high<br />
Eternal Wisdom, and the calm clear face<br />
Of Duty, and a higher, stronger Love<br />
And Light in one, and a new, reverend Name,<br />
Greater than any and combining all;<br />
And over all, veiled with a veil of cloud,<br />
God set far off, too bright for mortal eyes.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">And always, always, with each soul that comes<br />
And goes, comes that fair form which was my guide,<br />
Hovering, with golden wings and eyes divine,<br />
Above the bed of birth, the bed of death,<br />
Still breathing heavenly airs of deathless love<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>.</p>

<p class="v1 i2">For while a youth is lost in soaring thought,<br />
And while a maid grows sweet and beautiful,<br />
And while a spring-tide coming lights the earth,<br />
And while a child, and while a flower is born,<br />
And while one wrong cries for redress and finds<br />
A soul to answer, still the world is young!</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
